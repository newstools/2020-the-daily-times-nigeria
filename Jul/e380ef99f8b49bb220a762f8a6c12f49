 The Nigerians in Diaspora Monitoring Group (NDMG), UK Chapter, says the country needs the experience of its Service Chiefs now more than ever especially with recent successes recorded against terrorists and bandits. In a statement signed by its President, Mark Kola, on Tuesday in London, the group said those calling for their dismissal are sponsored to promote an escalation of the crimes being committed against Nigerians by terrorists. According to the Nigerians in the diaspora, there is an agenda to use the demand for the Service Chiefs’ sack as an excuse to cause further security breaches and those behind this act are doing so on behalf of the opposition and certain foreign interests. After reviewing the security concerns in the country, the Nigerians in Diaspora Monitoring Group concluded that the experience of the military heads is necessary to defeat complicated and foreign-sponsored conspiracies. NDMG urged President Muhammadu Buhari to resist those attempting to coerce him into error as “countries do not run their defence and security on the basis of political correctness”. The group, however, advised  Nigerians being used by foreign interests to look beyond the pittance they are being paid to run their current errand.
