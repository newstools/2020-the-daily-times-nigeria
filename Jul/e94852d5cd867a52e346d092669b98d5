NAPTIP charged Suleiman with three counts bordering on sexual abuse. Justice Peter Kekemeke also ordered the defendant’s counsel to put the prosecution on notice. He then adjourned the matter until July 13 for the hearing of the defendant’s application for bail. Earlier, the prosecution counsel, Mr. A.O. Shaibu told the court that the defendant, who lives with his family in Karu a suburb of Abuja, committed the offence from June 2018 to February this year. Shuaibu said between these dates, the defendant allegedly sexually abused his 16-year-old and 14-year-old daughters and inflicted injuries on them. The offence he said contravenes the provisions of Section 1 (2) of Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act 2015. However, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge. His counsel, Mr. Labio Oji, applied orally for his bail, pursuant to Sections 158 and 162 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), 2015. Objecting, Shaibu told the court that a matter as serious as this should not be taken lightly by oral bail application.
