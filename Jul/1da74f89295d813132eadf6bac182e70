As insecurity worsens, no less than 395 Nigerians were killed in different attacks across the country in the month of June. Most of the attacks, which took place in the northern part of the country, were carried out unhindered as security agencies were not available to protect the people from the onslaught. According to the latest life count by the Civic Media Lab, 48 persons were also kidnapped in the country. The report also highlighted how bandits and members of the Boko Haram terrorist group carried out their attacks in Borno, Katsina, Niger, Kogi, and Zamfara States. In a breakdown of the attacks, 167 Nigerians were killed by bandits in June 2020.
