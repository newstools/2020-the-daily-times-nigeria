 As the September 19 governorship election in Edo draws near, a former Commissioner for Information and Orientation in the state, Prince Kasaim Afegbua, has alleged that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), only conceded its ticket to Governor Godwin Obaseki because he controls the state’s funds to finance the campaign. Afegbua, who is a member of the PDP, but described the choice of Obaseki as a bad omen for the party, accusing the PDP of grabbing the governor’s trousers by the pocket. The former Commissioner’s position which was contained in a statement against the backdrop of the PDP’s plot to suspend him from the party at his ward, said, “My current position is informed by a number of factors. First, it is wrong for a party to surreptitiously surrender its apparatus, privileges, structures and ‘ideological’ stratosphere to a new entrant as though there were no persons in the party.” He lamented that the PDP postponed scheduled primary elections within 24 hours and all processes leading to the event were disrupted just because of a new entrant. “If the urge was dictated by altruistic intention to feature Godwin Obaseki on account of strong and result-driven leadership, or performance, one could have understood, but anywhere I turned, the motivation was that Obaseki has state funds to fund the campaigns. Should that be a selling point if truly we are serious-minded opposition?” The PDP chieftain recalled that only three months ago, his party lambasted Obaseki for his lacklustre leadership, scoring him F9 in all the critical sectors of the Edo economy. The APC disqualified Obaseki from participating in the June 22 primary election, alleging inconsistency in his certificate.
