The U.S. killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in a “defensive action,” the Pentagon says. “At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken 
decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing 
Qassem Soleimani,” the Pentagon statement says. The Pentagon says Soleimani was “actively developing plans to attack 
American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the 
region.” “General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week,” the statement continues. The U.S. also held Soleimani and his Quds Force responsible for the 
deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and said he
 “orchestrated” a rocket attack on Dec. 27, which killed an American.
