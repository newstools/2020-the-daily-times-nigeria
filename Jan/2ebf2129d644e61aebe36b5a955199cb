Emboldened by Tuesday’s Supreme Court judgement on Imo State that sacked Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as governor and installed Senator Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Chairman of the APC in Anambra State, Chief Basil Ejidike, has said that only God can stop the party from winning next year’s governorship election in the state . The APC chairman, who spoke to journalists in Awka after attending the swearing in ceremony of Uzodinma in Owerri, said that nothing would stop the party from winning the 2021 election in the state. He said: “You know that I had just arrived from Imo State where I had gone to felicitate with our brother members in Imo State over the emergence of Senator Hope Uzodinma as governor of the state. “My joy surely knows no bounds as the victory is a victory for the progressives and a sign that APC is fast becoming accepted as a party in the South East region. “As a matter of fact, as we awaited the arrival of Governor Uzodinma, the National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomole who had arrived a few minutes earlier on sighting me said ‘congratulations, you are no longer an orphan.’ “For which, I, in turn, declared before members of the National Working Committee and the crowd that after Imo, Anambra will  be the next state to join the party’s fold come 2021.
