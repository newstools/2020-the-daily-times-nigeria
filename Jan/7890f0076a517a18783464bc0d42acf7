Melbourne (Australia) – Australian Open organisers monitoring the deteriorating air quality in Melbourne said matches could be suspended if conditions become hazardous amid the bush fire crisis. Hundreds of fire incidents have killed no fewer 25 people and ravaged more than eight million hectares (19.8 million acres) of land across Australia over the last few months. With the season’s first Grand Slam qualifiers starting on Jan. 14, Tournament Director Craig Tiley said officials could halt play if smoke poses a danger to players’ health.

There have so far been no smoke-related delays at the ATP Cup, which is taking place in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.
