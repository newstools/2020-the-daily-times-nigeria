In its bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has shut down the Chinese-owned Panda Supermarket in the Jabi area of Abuja. In a series of tweets on its verified Twitter handle, the FCCPC said that it has confiscated some frozen food items illegally imported from China. The pictures of the confiscated frozen food items posted on Twitter showed that they had an expiry date of 2089 which further aroused suspicion that they were not certified by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). “The FCCPC inspected Panda Supermarket, Jabi, on credible reports that it discriminated and had a concealed area for Asian nationals. The allegation was confirmed. Seafood and animal products imported illegally from China were discovered. “The store was closed for cautionary reasons considering the coronavirus. Products with expired and irregular shelf life were also discovered at Panda. Regulatory activities to remove all such products from the supermarket continue. “The federal government had earlier in the week assured Nigerians of its readiness to strengthen surveillance at five international airports in the country to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” the agency twitted. Meanwhile, the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire has said that the government would also set up an inter and multi-sectoral committee to scale up surveillance and vigilance.
