The State Commissioner of Energy and Mineral Resources,  Olalere Odusote expressed the desire of the current administration to create enabling environment for oil companies in the state in line with its campaign for ease of doing business. He also said the current administration in Lagos was determined to promote clean energy and improve its use in Lagos.“Over 200 schools in Lagos are currently benefitting from solar energy and the administration is making spirited efforts to bring in more schools into the mix. We also plan to pan out the first phase of gas-powered vehicles for public transport in 2020 which was driven by the desire of the current administration to deepen the use of gas by fixing infrastructure in the state. This sector is of outmost importance and its improvement should be a collaborative effort between the government, private sector and the end-users”. Odusote disclosed this at the inaugural “Enyo Correspondents Breakfast Session” organised by Enyo Retail and Supply.
