Liverpool remain in seventh place in the latest edition of
the Deloitte Football Money League, but recorded a £77.9 million increase in
revenue after a hugely successful 2018/19 season. The annual Deloitte rankings breaks down and profiles the highest revenue generating clubs in world football, with season 2018/19 under the microscope – whereby the Reds secured their sixth European Cup and finished second in the Premier League.

saw the Reds’ total revenue last season amount to £533 million, a £77.9m (17
percent) rise on 2017/18. Broadcast revenue saw another sizeable increase, as
expected, due to greater distributions from UEFA and the Reds securing the
highest percentage of funds from the Premier League, with a total £41.2m rise
from last season. Notably, Deloitte also pointed to the impact of Anfield
hosting concerts as a key contributor to commercial growth (up £34.6m)
alongside their exploits on the field. Liverpool’s revenue in 2018/19 sees them positioned in
seventh place, with the Premier League strongly represented in the top 10 with
five sides, while a further three reside in the top 20 worldwide. The Reds are sat behind only Man United (third) and Man City
(sixth), but the former is at risk of losing their position as the highest
revenue-generating club in England after failing to qualify for the Champions
League this season and with no assurances that it will change come next year
either. Despite an increase in revenue and a domestic treble, City
dropped one place due to the rise of Paris Saint-Germain.
