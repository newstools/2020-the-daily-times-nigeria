NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has called an urgent meeting of the military alliance’s North Atlantic Council on Monday in response to growing tensions in the Middle East. The ambassador-level meeting of the alliance’s main decision-making body will address the situation in Iraq after the killing of Iranian top general Ghassem Soleimani by the U.S. military, a spokesman told dpa in Brussels on Sunday. The ambassadors of the North Atlantic Council usually meet once a week, while its foreign and defence ministers meet around twice a year. The meeting is scheduled for Monday at 3 pm (1400 GMT).

Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad on Jan. 4. “Yesterday I spoke to my US counterpart Secretary [Mark] Esper and we urge all parties to engage to de-escalate the situation,” said Wallace. “During the last few months US forces in Iraq, who are based in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, have been repeatedly attacked by Iranian backed militia.” Wallace said: “General Soleimani has been at the heart of the use of proxies to undermine neighbouring sovereign nations and target Iran’s enemies. “Under international law the United States is entitled to defend itself against those posing an imminent threat to their citizens.”
