Diego Alonso has been named the first head coach of David Beckham’s Inter Miami ahead of their inaugural season in the North America’s Major League Soccer. “In Diego we found a manager that fits our culture and has a strong desire to build a winning club for our fans,” said Inter Miami spokesman Paul McDonough.

Alonso, the only coach to win the CONCACAF Champions League with two different teams, reportedly beat out former New York City manager Patrick Vieira and former DC United midfielder Marcelo Gallardo for the job. The 44-year-old Alonso most recently served as head coach for Monterrey in Mexico. He was fired three months ago after a 2-0 loss to rival Tigres. Before being sacked he led Monterrey to the 2019 CONCACAF Champions League title. Two years earlier he guided Pachuca to the CONCACAF Champions League crown.
