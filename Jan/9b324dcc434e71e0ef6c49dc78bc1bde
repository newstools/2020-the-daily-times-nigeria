The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said there was no casualty recorded in Imo during the yuletide. Mr Evans Ugoh, NEMA Head of Imo/Abia operations, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Owerri. According to him, the milestone was achieved through diligent collaboration among disaster stakeholders. He said the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and other disaster outfits braced up to road challenges during the period, which he said was the major reason for the zero casualty. Ugo said that both NEMA and FRSC deployed their men to strategic places in Imo and Abia states and were also visible in rural communities. He expressed NEMA’s readiness to sustain the disaster management proficiency in 2020. “We have reviewed activities during the yuletide and we recorded zero casualty in Imo and we are ready to sustain the milestone this year.
