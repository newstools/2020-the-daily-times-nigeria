Abdulrazaq gave the condemnation  in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye , in reaction to a  video footage which featured one Ms Ajayi Omolola, a victim of human trafficking in Lebanon. Omolola, whose parents live in Ilorin, was tricked into travelling to Lebanon in the guise of engaging her as an English tutor and instead of employing Omolola as a tutor, she was being used as a slave. “The governor condemns this development in the strongest terms possible, and has immediately linked up with the security agencies to get to the root of the matter. “We are glad to announce that three suspects, comprising two Nigerians and the Lebanese referred to in the footage, have been arrested in connection with the case and the suspects are being interrogated. “Apart from Ms Ajayi, discreet investigations by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), in Kwara State have revealed that there are at least 28 other victims of this horrible trafficking gang. “The governor is concerned that fellow human beings are engaging in another round of slavery despite the horror and unquantifiable loss of the 20th Century,” the statement said. It urged residents to be bold to report any such activity they might know of in their neighborhood. “He also calls for the highest penalty for anyone caught in the activity, no matter their class in the society, to deter others from engaging in it,” the statement added. The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Ilorin arrested one Lebanese and two others for alleged human trafficking. NSCDC Public Relations Officer, Mr Ayeni Olasunkanmi, said: “An arrest has been made of one Lebanese and two others. They were arrested in Ilorin on Jan. 7, 2020 for specialising in trafficking young girls to Lebanon for purposes of child labour and other related abuses,”. He noted that the arrest was made possible through a coordinated intelligence, provided by the Kwara State Command of the NSCDC, following a tip off. Olasunkanmi said the State Commandant, Commandant Bello Ale, had afterwards ordered a thorough investigation into the matter, with a view to unravel other syndicates.
