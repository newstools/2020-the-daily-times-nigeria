An Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado Ekiti has slammed an imprisonment of ten years on a 40-year-old man, Akeem Bakare, for burglary. Justice Lekan Ogunmoye, who convicted Bakare, held that the prosecution has proved the case of burglary preferred against the convict beyond reasonable doubt. While convicting Bakare and imposing a prison term of ten years without option of fine, Justice Ogunmoye said the sentence was a lenient one with the convict being a first offender. The judge ruled: “I believe that I should be lenient with the accused in that regard. “He is sentenced to ten years imprisonment without an option of fine.” According to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Mr. Gbemiga Adaramola, the offence was committed on or about 31st of December, 2017 at Road 6, Ifesowapo Street, Better Life area of Ado Ekiti.
