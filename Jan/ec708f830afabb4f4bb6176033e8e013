President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in a statement on Saturday that his country expects a full investigation, a full admission of guilt and compensation from Iran after the downing of a passenger plane. Iran had earlier said it mistakenly shot down a plane killing all 176 people aboard and voiced its deep regret, after initially denying it brought down the aircraft in the tense aftermath of Iranian missile strikes on U.S. targets in Iraq.
