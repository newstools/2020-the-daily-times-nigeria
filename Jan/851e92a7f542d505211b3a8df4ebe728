THE United States of America embassy in Nigeria has said that the reports that the founder, Living Faith Church, worldwide otherwise known as Winners International, Bishop David Oyedepo was denied Visa to the United State is “Fake News and completely false.” Bishop Oyedepo was reported to have visited the Lagos Consulate of the US embassy to renew his visa on Thursday but was refused under the guise that “he did not qualify for visa renewal in its assessment.” A THISDAY report said the embassy did not give any other reason to the bishop, except the standard default explanation that the Bishop did not qualify for visa renewal in its assessment and urged him to try again.
