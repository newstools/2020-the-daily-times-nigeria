sufficiency and job creation in Nigeria. Nanono said this during a courtesy visit to the Governor of Ogun
State, Prince Dapo Abiodun in Government House, Abeokuta on Tuesday. According to a statement by the ministry’s spokesperson, Ezeaja

industrial processing, packaging and marketing. Nanono informed that the Federal Government under the
leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari would commence Agricultural
Mechanization initiative in the next three to four months. He said the programme will be private sector driven and that
government would only create the enabling environment and offer assistance
where necessary While acknowledging cocoa production in Ogun State, Nanono
stressed that the need to revive the cocoa industry in Nigeria. “we must develop new cocoa varieties in Nigeria because
the new cocoa varieties will yield in 2 1/2 years,’’ he said. He reiterated that the programme would have service centers
across the country, 140 processing centers, and it would enhance production,
create more jobs and grow the nation’s Internally Generated Revenue. In his speech, Governor Prince Dapo Abiodun emphasized that
Ogun is the closest state to the biggest economically viable state- Lagos and
also the food basket of the nation. He informed that there is massive investment in capacity
building especially in extension services, which aims at improving yields in
farm products like cassava, maize, cotton, rice, among others. He further said
that the State runs background checks for the extension service workers to
ensure accountability and transparency.
