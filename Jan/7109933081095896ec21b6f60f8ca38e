Boeing has recorded a decline of $636 million loss in profit, its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019, has shown. The firm fourth quarter results published on Wednesday show that the company lost $636 million in 2019 compared to a $10.46 billion profit in 2018. Revenues for the final quarter of 2019 were $17.91 billion compared with $28.34 billion during the same period in 2018. Revenue for the full-year in 2019 was $76.6 billion. Boeing unsurprisingly cited the ongoing 737 Max troubles as the main reason for its poor financial results. The manufacturer was forced to ground the plane in March 2019 after 737 Max two crashes killed 346 people. It is estimated that the cost of the Max crisis has topped more than $18 billion so far. The planemaker’s annual aircraft sales and deliveries have also taken a hit. David Calhoun, Boeing’s new CEO, said that the company has “a lot of work to do”. He said: “We are focused on returning the 737 Max to service safely and restoring the long-standing trust that the Boeing brand represents with the flying public. “We are committed to transparency and excellence in everything we do.  Safety will underwrite every decision, every action and every step we take as we move forward. “Fortunately, the strength of our overall Boeing portfolio of businesses provides the financial liquidity to follow a thorough and disciplined recovery process.” Read Also: Port Harcourt International Airport records smooth flight schedules after bush fire Boeing said last week that it expects the Max to return to the skies by mid-2020 after the FAA has cleared it for flight.
