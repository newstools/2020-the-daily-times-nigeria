She brings different kinds of men to my house. ”My 10-year-old son told me that a certain man called Biodun, usually comes around in the night whenever I travelled on my business trips. “The boy also said that the man usually leaves early in the morning after he and his mother had slept together on our bed. “Worst still, I recently returned from one of my business trips from Lagos, I saw a letter on the table in the sitting room from that same Biodun describing the escapades between him and Adeola. “As I speak now, Adeola has packed away most of my property, locked the house and taken away the key. “In fact, Adeola threatened me with a machete after I confronted her,” he alleged.
