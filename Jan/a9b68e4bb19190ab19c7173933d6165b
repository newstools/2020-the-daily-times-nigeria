and cases take a long time to be processed, with a four-year ban the maximum
punishment. Despite being tested late in November,
Diaby has still played for Barnsley with his last game coming against Huddersfield
Town on January 11. Former Southport defender Mike Phenix is
believed to be the last positive case after testing positive for cocaine in
September 2018 and his four-year ban was only announced in May 2019. The Football Association works in
partnership with UK Anti-Doping and drug testers regularly target players after
games and at training grounds in out-of-competition tests.
