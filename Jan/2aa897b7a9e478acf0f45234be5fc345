Jos – The Police Command in Plateau said it had deployed its personnel to key areas to prevent the breakdown of law and order following the killing of Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force by the U.S. on Friday. DSP Terna Tyopev, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the command disclosed this in an interview on Monday. He added that the command acted based on the directive of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu. U.S TSA assesses Lagos Airport The IGP had on Sunday placed police commands and formations nationwide on red alert following intelligence reports that some domestic interests were planning to embark on massive public disturbances and sabotage. The killing of the Iranian military commander through a drone strike on his convoy at the Baghdad International Airport raised the level of tensions between the U.S. and Iran. According to Tyopev, the command is taking the directive seriously. “We are very serious about the directive from the IGP and that is why we have deployed our men to sensitive areas and places where the U.S. has interest. “We are not taking anything to chance because the world is a global village and what happens elsewhere could have a ripple effect here. “That is why we have to take measures to avert it. “Even if anything will happen in Nigeria, we don’t want it to start from Plateau and so we have done the needful in that regard,” he said. Tyopev called on residents of the state to remain calm and to desist from acts that could constitute security threat to the state. He added that the police and other security agencies were working assiduosly to safeguard the lives and property of people of the state. (NAN)
