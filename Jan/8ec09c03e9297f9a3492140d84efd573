In a press statement signed by the coordinator, Centre for Information Press and Public Relations, CIPPR, Lagos State University, Mr. Ademola Adekoya, each student will be allotted specific time to appear and sit for the examination; Explaining what transpired during the examination that led to the stampede, it stated that 100 Level students were scheduled to write the GNS 102 Examination on Monday 6th and Tuesday, 7th January 2020, between 8am- 2pm daily. The students were scheduled to write the exam in batches, each batch spending an hour in the CBT hall;  and the arrangement would have seen the students write in six batches on the first day.
