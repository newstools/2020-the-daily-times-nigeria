Kuti further explained that contractors on the Lagos-Badagry expressway were already back on site to continue the construction work. Speaking on the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway, the controller said that the issues slowing down the project were being resolved to ensure that the contractor returned to site. Kuti, who declined comment on those issues, assured that the contractors would soon return to site to continue work. He assured road users that the Federal Ministry of Works would use the dry season to speed up the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the federal roads in Lagos. “Lagosians should expect very serious work as we enter the New Year. We are starting heavily. We are in the dry season which is construction period. Work is starting; road users should expect construction activities all over the state. “In all our projects, we hope to push very well; we want to hit the ground running early in the New Year,” he said.
