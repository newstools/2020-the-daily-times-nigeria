Comrade Dominic said it was sad that despite the fact that “He (Omo-Agege) just left Canada where he actively participated in the 25th biennial parliamentary leaders’ conference from January 6 to 10 this year, the group tried fruitlessly to make a truly distinguished populist to look like a wanted criminal”. Speaking further, he said that the group over stepped their boundaries by issuing a threat to invade the National Assembly if Senator Omo-Agege was not impeached and removed from office. While describing it as laughable, he said that CSGGG alone can immediately mobilize thousands of people and other conscious Nigerians from each geopolitical zones to effectively neutralize the little band of mischief-makers. “We dare them to either go ahead with any legal challenge to test the justification for their baseless allegations or carry out the threat of descending on the National Assembly with their hired crowd; while we commend Senator Omo-Agege for being unperturbed and level-headed about it all, our people’s response will be much more physical and we are waiting.” Said Dominic
