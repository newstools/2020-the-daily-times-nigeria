Lalong has given me free hands to operate , he carries me along despite the fact that I was elected under the Platform of the PDP. “I am appealing to the governor to also carry the PDP along as he develop the State and pursue projects and programs that will promote lasting legacies for the people. “I call on him to operate a unity government even as he strives to bring dividends of democracy to the people of Plateau”, the LG boss said.
