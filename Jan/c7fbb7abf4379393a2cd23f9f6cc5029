The Gunners have been scouting Guimaraes, along with
Chelsea, but may not move for the midfielder until the summer, though Benfica
could force their hand after already submitting a bid. Arsenal are interested in signing Athletico Paranaense star Bruno Guimaraes, according to the Brazilian club’s president. READ ALSO:  Lobi’s Alimi joins Tunisian club Paranaense chief Mario Celso Petraglia confirmed Arsenal had
been monitoring the player, but face competition from Benfica for his
signature. Both Arsenal and Chelsea have sent scouts to watch the
22-year-old defensive midfielder, and the feedback has been positive. However Benfica are leading the race to land Guimaraes,
after making an offer at the weekend, while Arsenal are not believed to be in a
position to sign him until the summer. Petraglia told Portuguese outlet O Jogo ( via Metro ):
“Yes it’s true. Yesterday came the official offer from Benfica to sign
Bruno Guimaraes. “Let’s study Benfica’s offer. On Monday we will meet
the club board to assess this situation. “Arsenal are interested, but will only make an offer towards
the end of the season.” Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has his hands tied this transfer
window, as the club have placed restrictions on new signings. Following an expensive summer Arsenal are limited to loan
additions, forcing Arteta to re-evaluate his primary targets. Signing a defender remains priority following the long-term
injury to Calum Chambers. RB Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano and Bayern Munich’s
Jerome Boateng were high on Arteta’s wish list, but a move for either is
unlikely until the end of the season.
