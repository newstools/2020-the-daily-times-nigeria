I had two great years at the Club previously and still have a lot of friends here, so I had no hesitation in coming back,” he said. “West Ham is a massive club, with fantastic supporters and an excellent squad of players. “It’s a great challenge for me and I am really looking forward to working with the goalkeepers here and helping the team in any way I can. “I’d like to thank everyone at Middlesbrough – the management, staff, players, and fans – for their support. I had a great time there and wish them all the very best for the rest of the season. “This opportunity was simply too good to turn down, though. It’s a great feeling to be back in the Premier League with such a fantastic club, and I can’t wait to get started.” The 32-year-old enjoyed a successful time at the East London club, taking part in the historic final game at the Boleyn Ground against Manchester United in May 2016 and the first-ever match played at London Stadium, a UEFA Europa League qualifying win over Domzale of Slovenia, three months later.
