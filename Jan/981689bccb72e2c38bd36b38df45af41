Muguruza will face Kazakhstan’s Zarina Diyas who beat Russia’s Anna Blinkova 6-1 6-7(9) 6-4 in a match that lasted two hours and 45 minutes. Blinkova had upset top seed BelindaBencic on Tuesday and despite breaking Diyas five times, she dropped serve nine times herself and made 11 double faults which proved decisive. Fifth seed Ekaterina Alexandrova of Russia got the better of China’s Peng Shuai, a former finalist, with a 7-6(7) 6-1 victory. The home fans did have reason to cheer, however, when fourth seed Wang Qiang overcame Belarusian Aliaksandra Sasnovich, recording a 6-4 0-6 7-6(5) victory.
