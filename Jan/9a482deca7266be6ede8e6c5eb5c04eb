Lazio has been handed a €20,000 (£16,958) fine for their
fans’ racist abuse of Brescia striker Mario Balotelli, but have temporarily
avoided a stadium closure. The former Liverpool forward was subjected to abhorrent chants from sections of the Lazio supporters in last Sunday’s Serie A clash at Stadio Mario Rigamonti. READ ALSO:  Liam Millar returns to Liverpool Balotelli made officials aware of what was being heard from
the away section of the ground and the match was temporarily brought to a halt.
A stadium announcement was then made during the game urging the away fans not
to sing discriminatory songs towards the forward. Afterwards, Lazio condemned their away supporters for their
actions with a statement, declaring: “As always, Lazio dissociates in the
most taxing way from the discriminatory behavior carried out by a very small
minority of fans during the match against Brescia. “The club once again reiterates its condemnation of
such unjustified misconduct and confirms its intent to prosecute those who in
fact betray their sporting passion, causing serious damage to the image of the
club.” The Serie A has been notorious this season for racism, with
Romelu Lukaku, Franck Kessie, Dalbert Henrique, Miralem Pjanic, Ronaldo Vieira
and Kalidou Koulibaly also being subjected to offensive chanting in Italy this
season.
