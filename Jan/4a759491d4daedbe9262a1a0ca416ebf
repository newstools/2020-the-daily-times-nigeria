London – Premier League club Brighton and Hove Albion on Thursday said that three fans were arrested for a combination of racist and homophobic abuse. The fans, two home supporters and one from the visiting team, were thrown out during their side’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea on New Year’s Day. One home fan was ejected for racist abuse of Chelsea players while the other was thrown out because of homophobic abuse aimed at the opposition fans, the club said. The club said the Chelsea fan was removed from the stadium because of homophobic abuse directed at Brighton fans, and then arrested just as the other two. “Yet again our safety and stewarding team, along with Sussex Police, have had to deal with three separate and unwanted instances of disgusting racist and homophobic abuse,’’ Brighton chief executive and deputy chairman Paul Barber said in a statement on their website. The fans are likely to be banned for life and also face prosecution, but Barber said that more needs to be done to eradicate all forms of abuse from football stadiums.
