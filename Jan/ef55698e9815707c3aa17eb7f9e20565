We are aware of the state’s peculiarities and we will be guided by this.” Speaking further on how the command would relate with the public, Kokumo assured the Ooni that he would ensure mutual respect between the police and the residents. “Osun Police Command under my leadership will have huge respect for human rights. A suspect shall remain a suspect until his conviction by a law court. “My leadership will have zero tolerance for corruption. We want people to go about their normal businesses without fear of molestation from the police,” Kokumo concluded. Responding, Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, expressed confidence in Kokumo’s ability to further strengthen the peace currently being enjoyed in the State.
