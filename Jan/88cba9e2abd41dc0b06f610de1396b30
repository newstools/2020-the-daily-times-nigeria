Arrest all Ardos-Fulani leaders, community heads until they produce the killers. Emir of Kano cautions against self medication on Lassa fever “All community leaders should be in cell. Arrest them now, nobody is above the law. If they don’t produce the killers keep them in cell. Nobody has immunity except me and the Deputy Governor.
