President Muhammadu Buhari says though it may take a bit longer, the nation will surely put to an end to cases of social disorder in the north eastern part of the country and move ahead. The president gave the assurance when he received the European Union (EU) Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, at the State House, Abuja on Friday. He said: “If we were capable to fight a 30-month civil war and reorganised our country, I wonder why people are thinking that Nigeria cannot do it. “I assure you of Nigeria’s commitment to enhance and deepen cooperation with the EU in all areas. “Our priorities in the next level is to ensure that Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)  are rehabilitated  so that livelihood should be established and  the children should not lose  the opportunity to go back to school, which is very important for the future of that area and Nigeria  generally. “We have the experience of the civil war. I can recall the role of the military, the army; each commander had in his pocket how to behave himself and how to allow international bodies like you to go round and see for themselves that people are treated in the most humane way. “We have this experience and I assure you that we also have this confidence in your organisation. That is why I feel that Nigeria is capable of handling this crisis, it may take long but we are capable of handling it.” Buhari also appreciated the recent meeting in Germany which deliberated on the happenings in Libya. “The important thing really is weapons reaching the Sahel; the instability it is causing. “Look at the casualties in Mauritania, Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali; Libya has a direct impact on the stability of the Sahel. As for Boko Haram, we try to disabuse the minds of the people and I think our people now understand the basic dishonesty in it. “With my experience personally in the civil war, I am sure we will get over it,’’ he said. The President further assured that the newly created Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, would do a splendid job of managing the various humanitarian issues evolving from the north east. “I assure you that we are aware of these problems and we will continue to do our best. “The newly created Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs is coordinating NEMA  and others, to make sure that whatever resources we get  are well utilised. “The ministry will be accountable to the government instead of having too many bodies doing the same thing. We are also reaching out to foreign countries explaining to them our position, and we are confident we will get over it,’’ he added. Earlier, the EU commissioner emphasized that Nigeria has been playing a big role in the African continent and globally in economic, social and other spheres and asked for the development of a plan between the EU and Nigeria concerning the issues in the Northeast. Court remands 2 over alleged murder, possession of firearms He said he had visited Borno state and appreciated government’s efforts to end the conflict there. “We would like to support your efforts. We believe all relevant actors; military, civilian as well as humanitarian should come together. The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs is suggesting such high level dialogue. “In situations such as what we have in the northeast, international law and international humanitarian law should apply. “We believe in your efforts to end the conflict; military effort alone probably will not be sufficient without identifying and addressing the socio-economic factors causing it, “he stated.
