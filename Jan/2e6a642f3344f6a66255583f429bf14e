British clothing retailer Next edged up its profit forecast for the full 2019-20 year after better-than-expected sales in the Christmas trading period, helped by a much colder November than last year. Next, the first major UK listed retailer to update on Christmas sales, said on Friday full-price sales, including interest income rose 5.2 per cent in the period from Oct. 27, 2019 to Dec. 28, 2019 the bulk of its fiscal fourth quarter. That was 1.1 per cent ahead of Next’s internal forecast and compared to third quarter growth of 2 per cent. The group, which trades from about 500 stores in the UK and Ireland, about 200 stores in 40 countries overseas and its Directory online and catalog business, said its sales performance in the period was also assisted by improved stock availability in both its retail stores and online. As a result Next increased its full-price sales growth guidance for the year by 0.3 percentage points to 3.9 per cent and its profit guidance by 2 million pounds (2.6 million dollars) to 727 million pounds, an increase of 0.6 per cent on 2018-19.
