Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives said she would send the impeachment articles soon, but expressed misgivings over the stance of the Republican dominated Senate. “We are ready…We are concerned that the senators will not be able to live up to the oath that they must take to have an impartial trial,” she said at a press conference in Washington today ahead of the move by the House to vote on a War Power Resolution limiting President Trump’s military actions regarding Iran.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told reporters Wednesday. “If we’re going to do it, she should send them over,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said. “I don’t see what good delay does.”
