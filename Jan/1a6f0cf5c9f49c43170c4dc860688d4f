The  home of Senator Shehu Sani was invaded today, Tuesday by men of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC stormed the apartment in Wuse, Abuja at about 3:30pm on Wednesday looking  for incriminating evidence. The EFCC  had arrested the senator who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th National Assembly on December 31, 2019 on allegation of extorting $10,000 from Alhaji Sani Dauda, popular as ASD, owner of a Kaduna-based motor company. Knowledge Gap, Cultural Barriers Limiting Farmers in Northern Nigeria – Babban Gona Sani was elected senator in 2015, under the All Progressives Congress platform. When he could not get the party’s ticket in 2019, he ran on the ticket of the Peoples Redemption Party but lost to Uba Sani of the APC. He has been a trenchant critic of the APC government, both in Kaduna and Abuja, since then. Some of the offences the EFCC may slam the senator with are extortion, name dropping, and financial crimes.
