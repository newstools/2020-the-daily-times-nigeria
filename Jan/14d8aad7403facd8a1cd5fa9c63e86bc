A 40-year-old trader, James Isaac, on Friday appeared before an Ikeja
 Magistrates’ Court over alleged stealing of two phones valued at 
N113,000. Isaac, who lives at Ikorodu, Lagos, is facing charges of conspiracy and stealing. The Prosecutor, Insp. Mojirade Edeme, said that the defendant and one
 other person, yet to be apprehended, committed the offences on Nov. 15,
 2019, at Ketu, Lagos. She alleged that the defendant stole a Samsung Galaxy phone valued at
 N90,000 from  one Mr Joshua Ogunleye and a N23,000 Itel phone from  one
 Mr Joshua Okereke. “The defendant and his accomplice approached the complainants, 
claiming that their company needed young people like them to help to 
market their product. “They asked the complainants to give them their phones for them to save their numbers. “Immediately the complainants gave them their phones, they took to their heels,” she said Edeme said that few weeks after, the defendant and his accomplice, 
unknown to them, accosted the first complainant in another location and 
told him the same thing. The complainant recognised them, grabbed the defendant, raised alarm 
and got him  arrested, while his accomplice escaped,” the prosecutor 
said. According to the prosecutor, the alleged offences contravene Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 prescribes 
three years’ jail term for stealing, while Section 411 attracts two 
years’ impriosonmment  for conspiracy. Following his plea of not guilty, the Magistrate, Mrs O.A. 
Aderibigbe, released the defendant on bail of N100,000 with one surety, 
who should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax 
payment to the Lagos State Government. Aderibigbe adjourned the case until Jan. 8 for further hearing.
