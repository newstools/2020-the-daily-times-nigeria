Speaking at a news conference in Los Angeles, Fury (29-0-1) said he would down Wilder (42-0-1) in two rounds, while the champ said that Fury would not be able to withstand his powerful right hand this time around. “This is unfinished business that I will finish. I’m going to knock him out,” Wilder said. “I’m the lion, I’m the king of the jungle, and come February 22nd, I’m gonna rip his head off his body.” After proving an elusive target in their first fight, Fury promised to stand toe to toe with Wilder in the rematch. “I’ll meet you, Deontay, in the middle of the ring … I won’t be running, you won’t have to look anywhere for me.” TUC lauds Gov.

And that’s what this little skinny-legs super-noodle will have to do – nail me to the canvas,” he said of the tall and slender Wilder, whose body more resembles that of a basketball power forward than a traditional heavyweight boxer. “And if he can’t do that, I’m going to eat him up.” (Reuters/NAN)
