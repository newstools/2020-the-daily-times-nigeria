Reacting to the match’s result, coach Abdullahi Biffo of Kwara United told NAN it was a disappointing game from his players, adding “this is not what we bargained for”. Biffo, however, said such was the nature of the game of football, pointing out that his team would forge ahead to get better. While expressing confidence that his team would not be relegated from the NPFL, Biffo said his team would work very hard for that feat. Coach of the host team, Ibrahim Bariki, said the match was “very interesting’’. “This is what every coach expects. Our determination was good and it paid off.” Bariki, however, berated the match’s officiating, saying most of the fouls committed by the visitors were not punished by the match officials. The match officials had to be escorted out of the stadium by armed policemen as some of the home fans made attempts to attack them.
