A medical expert, Dr Bola Bello, has warned against sitting for too long on toilet seats as it could cause haemorrhoids also known as piles. Bello, who is a consultant in a private facility, said in an interview on Thursday in Ilorin that sitting on toilet seats for more than 15 minutes was not healthy.

The medical expert added that no matter how clean a toilet appeared to be, it was still an unhygienic place which harbours germs. ”In as much as some toilets are very neat and tempting to stay in for long, we should not forget that it is an unsafe and unhygienic place. ”If you can check your toilet under the microscope and see the number of germs in there, I am sure you will not want to stay that long in there. ”So, it is better to play safe and try to remain healthy,” Bello said.
