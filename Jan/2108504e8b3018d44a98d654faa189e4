I think that he gives us a lot of different qualities, but most importantly he fits the profile of the player we want to bring to the Club.

At the moment he ticks a lot of boxes. We need to give him the opportunity and time to settle in but we are confident he will prove to be a strong addition to the squad,” he added.
