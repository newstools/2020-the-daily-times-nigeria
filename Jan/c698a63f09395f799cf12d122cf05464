Gusau – The Leader of the Igbo Community in Zamfara (Eze Igbo Zamfara), Chief Egbuna Obijiaku, has called on the Federal Government to sustain its land border closure.

According to him, if the closure is sustained, Nigeria will justify its name much as the giant of Africa. “I am, therefore, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to sustain the closure for future benefits. “It is in the good intention of President Muhammad Buhari to move Nigeria to a higher level. ” I am also calling on all Nigerians to cooperate with Mr President, irrespective of our differences,” he added. The monarch also lauded the efforts of the state Gov. Bello Matawalle in promoting  peace and stability. “With the return of peace in the state in the young administration of Matawalle, socio-economic activities have been revived,” the Eze said. He lauded the people of Zamfara for being tolerant, accommodating and receptive to the Igbo community. “I appreciate, the state council of chiefs, led by the Emir of Anka, Alhaji Attahiru Ahmad, and the Emir of Gusau, Alhaji Ibrahim Bello, for  concerns for Igbo community,” he said. He urged the Igbo community to continue to be law-abiding and ensure peaceful  coexistence with other communities. He also urged them to engage only in legitimate businesses. (NAN)
