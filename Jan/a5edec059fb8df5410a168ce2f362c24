Absolutely swept me off my feet this past weekend, surprising me in the most meaningful location over one of our many shared passions. I can’t wait to spend the rest of our lives learning, growing, laughing and loving together. Yes a million times over. 💍 AHHH!!! A post shared by  Jennifer Gates (@jenniferkgates) on Jan 29, 2020 at 12:29pm PST The couple, who both attended Stanford University, each have
a love for the equine sport. In October last year, Nassar helped Egypt qualify for the
2020 Tokyo Olympic Games by winning the CSIO4*-W Nations Cup of Rabat. The feat led to the country’s first Olympic qualification for the sport in 60 years. Nayel also shared a post on his instagram with the caption “SHE SAID YES” SHE SAID YES!! 💍  I’m feeling like the luckiest (and happiest) man in the world right about now. Jenn, you are everything I could have possibly imagined..and so much more. I can’t wait to keep growing together through this journey called life, and I simply can’t imagine mine without you anymore. Love you more than you can possibly imagine, and thank you for making every single day feel like a dream to me. Here’s to forever! 😘❤️ A post shared by  Nayel Nassar (@nayelnassar) on Jan 29, 2020 at 12:49pm PST
