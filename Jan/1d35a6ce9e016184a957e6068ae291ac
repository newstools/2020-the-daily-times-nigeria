As at Monday morning, only $200 have been raised in a target
of $250,000 that former Nigeria player and coach, Samson Siasia is seeking to
pursue at the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS). Sports Village Square recalls that Siasia had on Saturday approached an American for profit crown funding platform, ‘GoFundMe’ to raise money to fight his legal battle.

raise money for events ranging from life events such as celebrations and
graduations to challenging circumstances like accidents and illnesses. From
2010 to 2017, over $5 billion was raised on the platform from 50 million
donors. The platform under an appeal code ‘Help Samson Siasia clear
his name at FIFA’ reports that Siasia has been alleged “to agree to collect bribe” in
relation to a football match. He was subsequently banned for life from all footballing
activities, without the benefit of defending himself. The Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) has now accepted
an appeal from Samson on FIFA’s ruling. His legal cost of defending himself is needed for him to
clear his name. Siasia, the organizer, is reportedly based at Hatfield, East of
England, United Kingdom. When Sports Village Square checked the platform on Monday
morning, the only donor was one Benson Ejindu who donated $200 of the targeted
$250,000. Before the appeal was launched on ‘GoFundMe’, former
Nigerian international, Kingsley Onye had in a telephone interview told Sports
Village Square that he would like current and former international Nigerian
footballers to come to aid of the embattled Siasia. Onye and Siasia were members of the Nigerian Under-20 team
that won the third place in the then Soviet Union at the 1985 World Youth
Championship, a competition that has since been renamed FIFA U20 World Cup.
