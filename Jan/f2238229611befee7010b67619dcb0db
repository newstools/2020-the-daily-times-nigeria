United’s skipper Ashley Young was left out of the squad to play Manchester City on Tuesday night amid speculation over a move to Inter Milan and when asked his captain, Solskjaer said that the question was supposed to be directed to the player. “I don’t know. You have got to ask Ash. For me, it is about focusing on the next game,” he responded.
