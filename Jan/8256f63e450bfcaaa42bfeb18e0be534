At least, anybody who watch Sunshine Stars regularly knows that we have a good team with quality players at least. So, I’m satisfied with what my players did,” he said. Kano Pillars’ Technical Adviser, Ibrahim Musa, said on his part that his intention was for his team to pick the maximum three points in Akure. “I am happy with the one point because Sunshine Stars are a good team. If you check the league’s table, they are fourth on the log while we are 12th. So, getting a point from them to me is a good thing. “We took our time to study the weakness of our opponents and we made efforts to capitalise on them in the second half. In the first half we didn’t play like the usual Kano Pillars. “We changed the style of the game in the dressing room. Now, we are going back home to ensure we get the maximum three points from them when they come visiting,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Sunshine Stars now have 27 points from 17 matches.
