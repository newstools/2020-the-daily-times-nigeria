Iraq’s powerful Shiite Hashd Shaabi militia said on Friday that the 
group’s deputy leader, Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes, and high-ranking Iranian 
General Qassem Soleimani have been killed in an attack near Baghdad 
airport. The Iran-backed Hashd Shaabi, also known as the Popular Mobilization 
Forces (PMF), said they were killed in a U.S. strike targeting their 
vehicle on the Baghdad International Airport road. Soleimani is the Commander of Iran’s Quds Force, a unit in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRCG). Their deaths are the latest escalation in tensions between the U.S.  and Iran, coming after thousands of supporters of the Shiite militia  broke into the U.S. embassy compound in central Baghdad on Tuesday. Protesters set fire to one of the gates of walls around the embassy buildings and camped outside until the next day. The two days of protests were triggered by U.S. strikes in Iraq and 
Syria on Sunday that targeted the Kataib Hezbollah militia group. The U.S. airstrikes killed at least 25 militiamen. Kataib Hezbollah, a part of the Hashd Shaabi umbrella group, had been blamed for an attack last week that killed a US citizen. Loud explosions were heard near the airport early Friday, which Iraqi
 security said was three Katyusha rockets falling down in the vicinity 
killing several people and leaving two vehicles burnt. Shortly after, the militia said five of its members were killed in 
the attack, including Mohammed Reda al-Jaberi, who was the group’s head 
of the public relations and protocol officer.
