Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, Director-General of NCDC, made the assertion while speaking on Sunrise Daily programme on Channels Television on Thursday morning. “The goal of the lockdown is not to get to the end of this outbreak because that is not a realistic goal. “On the goal of the lockdown, there are two things. “Firstly, to keep people a little bit apart so that we stop transmission to some extent. “And even though the lockdown has not been perfect, we have also some indicators to show that we are mixing a lot less,” he said. “There are some analysis from Google that shows us that in many of the places that we need to congregate it is down by 60, 70 per cent . “There is no doubt that there is less contact between individuals and that has hopefully had an impact on transmission.’’
