The number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus is nearing 2 million globally, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. A tally from the US-based university Monday shows the number of reported cases worldwide have roughly doubled since April 2, reaching more than 1.9 million, while the global death toll stands at 119,483. The Johns Hopkins online Covid-19 tracker had earlier recorded that worldwide cases had exceeded the 2 million milestone, but late Monday it revised the figure. The United States has the most cases, with more than 33 per cent of the total from around the world, followed by Spain, Italy and China. Germany comes in fifth with over 130,000 confirmed cases. The US has recorded more than 23,000 deaths, followed by Italy with 20,465, while Spain currently has 17,756, according to Johns Hopkins data. The deadly virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global pandemic. Most countries have now reported confirmed cases and many have imposed strict measures to slow the outbreak. Testing remains an issue worldwide, meaning the real number of cases is likely higher. The global effort to halt the spread of the deadly virus has stalled much the global economy, upended the lives of hundreds of millions of people and created shortages of medical supplies around the world.

In the US, the White House models forecast the virus may kill around 60,000 people. The vast majority of the country has been ordered to stay at home and limit social contacts, but some states are currently eyeing plans to reopen their economies. (dpa)
