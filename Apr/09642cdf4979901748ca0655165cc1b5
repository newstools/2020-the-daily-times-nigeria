The Rivers State University(RSU), Port Harcourt, says it has concluded plans to re-open for full academic activities online on Monday. The Registrar of the institution, Dr Sydney Enyindah, said in a statement in Port Harcourt on Thursday that the resumption was sequel to the state government’s order to tertiary institutions to resume online learning. “Acting on the directive, the Senate of RSU at a meeting on April 28 approved the resumption of online academic activities effective Monday, May 4. “To this end, postgraduate online lectures shall commence on May 4 while first semester examinations for undergraduate students will start online on May 11. “Also, all lecturers’ meetings and meetings with students shall be online using web-based video conferencing options in line with physical distancing directives,” he said. Enyindah also urged parents and guardians to provide the necessary tools to enable their children and wards to effectively participate in the online lectures and examinations. According to him, only students that have completed their registration will have access to the university portal to participate in the examinations. “We encourage students, who have not completed their registration, to quickly do so, while students are also advised to check the university website, www.rsu.edu.ng, for further information. “The university urges students to continue to stay at home in line with the physical distancing directives of both the state and Federal Government,” he added.
