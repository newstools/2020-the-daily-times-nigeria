On Thursday domestic leagues were urged not to abandon the competition as UEFA plans to resume football around July. The outbreak of the coronavirus saw all the matches postponed but the European Club Association and European League body have urged leagues not to abandon their season.

UEFA working groups have been assessing the legal, regulatory and financial issues caused by the abrupt halt to football and formulated plans to resume competitions beyond the planned completion of the 2019-20 seasons by June 30 when it is safe to do so. “Their work is now focusing on scenarios encompassing the months of July and August, including the possibility that the UEFA competitions restart after the completion of domestic leagues.” “A joint management of calendars is strictly required as the conclusion of the current season must be coordinated with the start of the new one, which may be partly impacted because of the overstretch.” European leagues are planning to hold a conference call to discuss the letter on Friday. The 20 English Premier League clubs are also meeting by video conference on Friday to discuss plans to complete the campaign, with teams having nine or ten games left to play.
