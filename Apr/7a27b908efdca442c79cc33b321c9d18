Garba called on members of the public to disregard the claims and consider it fake, fabricated and of no basis. He said the Vice Chancellor has been hale and hearty. He revealed further that the VC was not a member of the Kano State Task Force on COVID-19, chaired by the Deputy Governor of the state as claimed in the reports. According to him, the claims are fabrication by some elements who do not wish the University and people of Kano well.
