A Nigerian Catholic priest,  Fr. Anselm Adodo, OSB has developed a herbal remedy”CVD PLUS” for the treatment of covid-19. Being the Director of Pax Herbal Clinic and Research Laboratories in Edo State, Fr. Anslem released a statement on the company’s page on Facebook, on Thursday, 29 April, 2020. The Catholic priest noted that the drug was in response to Nigeria’s demand and high expectation from the renowned laboratory to come out with a drug to fight this pandemic. Fr. Anselm stated that plant-based drugs are supposedly the best approach for the Coronavirus disease considering that these drugs are easily produced, stored and distributed and can be handled by medical and non medical personnel as they pose low contamination risk. According to him, the ‘CVD PLUS’ drug is made up of  antiviral and immunodulatory agents which help to stimulate antibody production against coronavirus related diseases. Confirming the news to the Daily Times in a telephone interview, the Company’s spokesperson noted that the drug has been presented to the National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration Control (NAFDAC) and is still under investigations. The statement also noted that NAFDAC is also set to speed up the drug regulation, evaluation and approval process of CVD PLUS. Fr. Anslem expressed gratitude to the Head of the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Professor Tunde Salako and the Director General of NAFDAC, Professor Catherine Adeyeye for interest, support and encouragement in the course of the research.
