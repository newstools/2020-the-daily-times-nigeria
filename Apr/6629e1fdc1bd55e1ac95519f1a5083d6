Angela Merkel, German Chancellor has gone into quarantine after being informed that a doctor who administered a vaccine to her has tested positive for the coronavirus. Ms Merkel’s spokesman said she was informed about the doctor’s test shortly after holding a news conference on Sunday, in which she announced new measures to curb the spread of the virus including a ban on groups of more than two people congregating in public. Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said Ms Merkel had received a precautionary vaccine on Friday against pneumococcal infection. Mr Seibert said in a statement that Ms Merkel, 65, would undergo “regular tests” in the coming days and continue with her work from home for the time being. Ms Angela is not the first major world leader to have entered quarantine over the virus. Earlier this month Canada’s Justin Trudeau was quarantined after his wife tested positive for the virus. It comes after Ms Merkel confirmed Germany would ban public meetings of more than two people as the nation works on slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The policy does not apply to those who live in the same household she noted, in the latest measure to limit passage of the virus that has infected more than 22,000 people in the country but only led to 84 deaths – a significantly lower rate than that seen in the rest of the world. “The danger lies in the direct social interaction,” state premier Armin Laschet said, adding that the federal government and regional states had agreed on the stricter rules.
