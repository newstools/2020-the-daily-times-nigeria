A 22-year-old man, Baari Bacha, has been arrested by the police in Damaturu, Yobe state for cutting off the hand of his wife, Halima Bulama, from the wrist over her alleged refusal to obey his orders not to attend a ceremony held by her friend. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of Yobe state Command,  Dungus Abdulkarim, who disclosed this in a telephone interview with the Daily Times on Friday, said Bacha, who became furious after a heated argument with his wife, used a cutlass to perpetrate the act. “Preliminary investigation revealed that on April 14, the victim, Halima Bulama (20), sought permission from her husband to attend an event. But, he refused to grant her request and she left for the event after the husband has gone out. “When he came back, he asked of her whereabouts and was told that she has gone for the event. He went to look for her in the neighbourhood and couldn’t find her there. He proceeded to her parent’s house and found her there,” he stated. Dungus said the victim’s brothers prevailed on Bulama to follow her husband home, but she refused, which ignited an argument with her husband. He said that the husband, out of anger and provocation from his wife’s action, used a cutlass he had carried from home and amputated her hand in the presence of her brothers. The police spokesman while advising couples to ensure that all misunderstandings are amicably resolved without resorting to physical confrontation that will benefit no one, noted that domestic violence has been on the increase in Yobe state. The police image- maker who said that the victim is currently receiving treatment in the hospital said that the suspect will be charged to court after investigation is completed.
