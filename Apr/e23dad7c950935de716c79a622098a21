Idris Elba has hinted he caught coronavirus from Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, the wife of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. The Luther star revealed he tested positive for the illness earlier this week, telling his Twitter followers: “So look this morning I got some test results back for coronavirus and it came back positive. Yeah, and it sucks.” In a video updating his fans on his condition, the actor, 47, said he “[knows he’s] been exposed to it” from 4 March. “On Friday last week, I was told that someone that I had been in contact with had tested positive,” he said, adding that the figure is “also in the public eye”. It has now been pointed out that Elba was photographed alongside Sophie Grégoire Trudeau on 4 March at a charity event in London. Lewis Hamilton was also in attendance. Elba said he was made to test “immediately” as he was on location and risked exposing a lot of people to the virus, which is causing cities around the world to go on national lock down. He has been quarantined at home ever since.
