With the coming of the rains, Delta state including some other states in the south-south region, have been facing difficulties following the heavy rainfall and the havoc it wreaks whenever it rains. It was gathered that the rainstorm destroyed houses, 13 electricity poles and cables, thereby constituting serious threat to lives and property in the Obodogba Quarters of the community. A resident, Chief Luke Odiata, who spoke to journalists, said that they were currently living in the fear of the unknown following the destruction of the electricity poles and cables, considering the 14- day sit -at- home order caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, the Ugoani of Okpanam Kingdom, Mbanefo Ogbolu has appealed to the authorities of BEDC to take urgent steps to immediately replace the fallen poles and the destroyed cables littering the streets for safety purposes.
