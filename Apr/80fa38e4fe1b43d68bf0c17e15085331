By Patrick Okohue Following the call by the youths group of the Igbo social cultural organisation, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo  for the appointment of a person of Igbo extraction as the next Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari , as a result of the death of the former occupier of the office, Mallam Abba Kyari, another Igbo youths group, Biafra Nations Youth League (BNYL), has kicked against the call, describing the group calling for the appointment as a group of long throats who are no different from Almajiris. The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council (OYC), had in a statement signed by its President, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, and Secretary-General, Okwu Nnabuike, called for the appointment as a result of the death of Kyari from COVID-19 infections, urging the President to use the opportunity to “look inward, make amendments and clear doubts about his stance as the father of Nigeria” by appointing replacement from the Igbo speaking areas of Niger-Delta or South-East. However, the Biafra Nations Youth League (BNYL), in a move that many say  is the kind of actions that makes it difficult for the Igbo nation to unite and speak with one voice, said that the office of the Chief of Staff is irrelevant to the Igbos. National Leader of BNYL, Princewill Chimezie Richard described the Ohanaeze Youth body as a group of long throats who are no different from Almajiris. The OYC had yesterday while reacting to the death of Abba Kyari, the late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, demanded that the vacant office be filled by an Igbo man. While cautioning the youth President of Ohanaeze against misrepresenting the Igbo interest, the BNYL stated that the people of the South East are not beggars. “Ordinarily, I shouldn’t have responded, but it is a shameful thing that some group who call themselves Ohanaeze Youths are misrepresenting the interest of the Igbos as they claim to be an apex umbrella body, but I see them as long throats, no difference between them and Almajiri.” He said the BNYL is not concerned about any appointment given to anybody from the South East and South-South because none of the offices are favoring the Biafra actualisation.
