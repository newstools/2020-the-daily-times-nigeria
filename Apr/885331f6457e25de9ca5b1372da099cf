Former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timi Frank has berated the Federal Government for asking China for COVID-19 loans. Frank, a critic of President Muhammadu Buhari, is reacting to the news of China donating N48m to support Nigeria’s fight against Coronavirus. He criticised the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 for receiving COVID-19 aides from the Chinese amidst how they are treating Africans in China.

The politician urged the African Union and ECOWAS to forget their benefits and gains from China, and follow Magufuli’s footsteps in condemning the Chinese cruel acts against Africans.
