Standard Chartered announced that it will commit $1 billion of financing for companies that provide goods and services to help the fight against COVID-19, and those planning the switch into making products that are in high demand to fight the global pandemic. Companies in scope include all those associated with helping tackle COVID-19, including manufacturers and distributors in the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare providers, as well as non-medical companies that have volunteered to add this capability to their manufacturing output – goods in scope include ventilators, face masks, protective equipment, sanitisers and other consumables. NSE: Indices drop further by 0.14% Simon Cooper,
CEO of Corporate, Commercial & Institutional Banking at Standard Chartered,
said: “Clearly there’s a cost for companies to switch into these hugely in-
demand items, so it’s an area where we can potentially help them get these
processes up and running more quickly; and at the same time, we want to make
sure that existing manufacturers and service providers get the support they
need.” The bank intends
to provide at least USD1 billion of financing to those companies in the form of
loans, import/export finance or the working capital facilities that they use
for the day-to-day business operations to help them tool up, and help to exist manufacturers get their products to market. Standard
Chartered is also trying to identify companies that may wish to switch into or
add anti-virus products to their output but haven’t indicated that they will do
so at this stage. “Our industry teams are looking across our client base and,
given our understanding of clients’ current manufacturing processes, we’re
assessing which companies might want to consider adding these items to their
production line,” Simon added.
