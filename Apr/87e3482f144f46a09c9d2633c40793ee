Thirdly, developing countries should ensure they immediately set up teams to collaborate with developed countries in order to know their post COVID-19 strategic plans. This is very critical as many nations potentially could be ostracized in the nearest future. Business and trade for non-strategic developing countries would be hampered because new inter border (access) regulations may be stiff or strict thus imposing tough requirements such as mandatory 14-day quarantine period before final entry and which may be enforced for a period of 12 months â€“ 18 months. Nigeria must actively seek exclusion from grievous or stressful requirements for her citizens. Working now with these developed countries is very important to avoid the country being limited in trade and business capabilities. It is expected that these countries will come up with new regulations, protocols, standards and requirements into their homeland.

developing countries should embed teams to work and be part of post-COVID-19
outcomes from the WHO, EU, IATA, ICAO, FDA, and many other international bodies. Finally, a conversation about electability or governance requirements must now include
evidence of Crisis Management competences. These pandemics have revealed that
Biological Threats are real threats to National Security and thus crises

the Aviation sub-sector to seek out only growth or functional managers for
leadership positions in a post-Covid-19 World. Seyi Adewale,
