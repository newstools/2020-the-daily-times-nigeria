This is so that cardholders and the transacting public can continue to carry out their transactions as usual. In this regard, Interswitch is still working to respond to card operation issues within the stipulated time frame, as usual. The Management of the Interswitch Group posted a statement on the company’s social media pages, saying: “cardholders and the transacting the public are assured that all dispute management operations remain fully available and all chargebacks and disputes will be processed according to their regular timelines.” Interswitch reassures the general public that any news of disrupted operations flying across the media, are fake and should be disregarded. The company has charged its customers to keep transacting and not to panic. It has also encouraged the public to keep safe in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
