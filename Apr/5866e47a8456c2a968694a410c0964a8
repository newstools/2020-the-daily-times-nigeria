Controversial Nigerian journalist, Kemi Olunloyo  has sent  Twitter into a frenzy after posting on her Twitter handle  ”#BREAKING Reports that Nnamdi Kanu has died. This is one strong news I cannot authenticate. Kanu or IPOB will have to debunk this. I hope he’s fine. Good luck to everyone’   However many have reacted to her post as @favloadedblog saying   Is @KemiOlunloyo  A native doctor or medical doctor.. Nnamdi Kanu don’t need your stupid stunt to trend.. Whether dead or alive.. IPOB is a movement and it can never stop.. Remember to tell them that nnamdi Kanu is not dead tomorrow.. I think you miss this clothes
