Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, Lagos has convicted and sentenced one Babatunde Rufai, also known as Richard Abben, to nine months in prison for internet fraud. The convict, who is the owner and promoter of ‘Wear It All Boutique’ in Lekki, Lagos, was arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Lagos zonal office, on March 5 on a three-count charge bordering on stealing and obtaining money by false pretence to the tune of $5,000 (about N2million). A statement signed by the acting Head, Media and Publicity, Tony Orilade stated that one of the counts reads: “That you, Babatunde Sodiq Rufai (a.k.a Richard Abben) on or about December 12, 2007  in Lagos, with intent to defraud, used an email addressrichardabben@yahoo.com, wherein you represented yourself as an American citizen and obtained $5,000, thereby committed an offence contrary to Sections 278 (1),(2) and 285 (1) of the Criminal Code of Lagos state, 2011.” The defendant pleaded guilty to the charges preferred against him by the EFCC. Counsel for the EFCC, Hamed Yerima, further informed the court of a plea bargain agreement entered with the defence team and so urged the court to adopt same and sentence the defendant based on the terms of the agreement. Consequently, Justice Taiwo adopted the terms of the plea bargain and convicted the defendant accordingly. Delivering her judgement, Justice Taiwo held that: “I am mindful of this type of crime in our society, which is giving our country a bad image all over the world. “However, in view of the plea bargain agreement, the defendant is hereby sentenced to nine months in prison, with an option of N400,000 fine to be paid to the account of the federal government through the office of the EFCC.” The Judge also ordered that the three exotic cars recovered from the convict be forfeited to the federal government.
