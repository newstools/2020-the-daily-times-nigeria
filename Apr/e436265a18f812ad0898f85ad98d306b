FIFA president Gianni Infantino on Friday said that “no 
match” is worth “risking a single human life” and that world football’s 
governing body would be able to help financially national federations 
during the coronavirus pandemic. The majority of top football leagues and international competitions have been suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Infantino insisted that games would not resume until it was safe. “Our
 first priority, our principle, the one we will use for our competitions
 and encourage everyone to follow is that health comes first,” he said 
in a video message. “I cannot stress this enough. No match, no competition, no league is worth risking a single human life.” The
 German Bundesliga reportedly could restart behind closed doors in May, 
with players already back in training, while other leagues could also 
resume in the summer. “It would be more than irresponsible to force competitions to resume if things are not 100% safe,” added Infantino. “If we have to wait a little longer we must do so. It’s better to wait a little bit longer than to take any risks.” Infantino
 said that national football associations which are struggling 
financially would receive help from FIFA’s emergency relief fund. FIFA last week postponed all international matches scheduled for June. “We are today in a very strong financial situation,” Infantino said. “But
 our reserves are not FIFA’s money. It is football’s money. So when 
football is in need, we must think what we can do to help… It is our 
responsibility and our duty.”
