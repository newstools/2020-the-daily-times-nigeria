The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the April
 1 tweaking of fuel price from N125 to N123.5, insisting instead that 
the price be reduced to N90 per liter. In a 
statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, the opposition party 
argued that the reduction of pump price by N1.50k is offensive, 
fraudulent; a further display of cruelty and insensitivity of the All 
Progressives Congress (APC) to the plight of Nigerians, particularly as 
the nation battles the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The PDP 
insisted that the correct pump price of fuel is between N80 to N90 per 
liter, given the slump in the price of fuel and crude oil in the 
international market. The PDP held that any price beyond that is completely unacceptable, as it amount to fleecing Nigerians. The party berated the APC administration for “attempting
 to delude Nigerians by tweaking the cost decimals to create a 
misleading impression of price reduction while fleecing the unsuspecting
 public”. The PDP challenged the APC and its administration 
to explain how they arrived at the pump price of N123.5 instead of N90 
per liter despite the fall in international price. The PDP asked 
the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to disprove its claim by 
immediately publishing the full prevailing landing cost, the prevailing 
3% depot cost, the 3% trucking cost as well as the retail outlet admin 
cost and show why the pump price should be above N90 per liter. According
 to the PDP, Nigerians earlier had to bear the brunt of high cost of 
fuel in the face of high oil prices in the international market, thus it
 is only fair that they also enjoy the benefits of the cut in 
international prices. The PDP charged the government to 
immediately reduce the pump price to N90 as well as refund the accrual, 
so far, from the N35 per liter difference and channel same to provision 
of palliatives to Nigerians. Furthermore, the PDP reiterates its 
demand for the establishment of Eminent Nigerians Group to manage 
donations towards mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and ensure that the 
palliatives get to venerable Nigerians without any political and 
bureaucratic bottlenecks
