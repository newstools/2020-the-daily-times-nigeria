This feature explains basic facts you should know about the massacre. The Zaria massacre was a massacre carried out by the Nigerian Army in Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria, on Saturday, 12 December 2015, against Shia muslims, mostly members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria. At least 348 civilians were killed, with 347 bodies secretly buried by the army in a masse grave. The Army claimed that it had responded to an attempt to assassinate Nigeria’s Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai, by the Islamic Movement in Nigeria. This claim has been strongly rejected by the Islamic Movement and several human rights organizations who argue that the massacre occurred without any provocation and that all the protestors were unarmed. The incident is considered among the “notable human rights violation since the return to democracy” in Nigeria. It was the day that they buried all the corpses of the killed Shi’ah citizens in mass grave at Mando, Kaduna state without proper ritual as recommended by any religion and without differentiation between genders, the worst was that, some of them were alive and begging for water to survive. It was the day that they demolished worship centers, graveyards and a resident of top Shi’ah cleric, leader of Islamic Movement Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky. All these evilness and crimes against humanity were perpetrated by bloodsuckers Nigerian Army within 48 hours, while they rushed and washed bloodshed on the affected roads to hide evidence and fabricated concocted lies to justify all the killing, but unfortunately to them, all what they hide has become clearly to public.
