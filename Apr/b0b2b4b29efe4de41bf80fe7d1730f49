Through his self owned foundation, Nigerian singer, Mr. Dutch (Bright Ukpabi) has fed thousands of Nigerians to cushion the hardship of the Coronavirus pandemic caused as a result of the lock down imposed by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The “Keys to My Heart” crooner was able to achieve this through his “COVID-19 Food Relief Programme” to four States of the federation, namely, Lagos, Imo, Edo and the Federal Capital Territory. “We have been able to feed more than 50 thousand people, although we were not really counting numbers of people but in some locations we reached out to 2 thousand people, some places were about 1 thousand while some locations were 5 hundred people. We went to different areas and States, distributing food, sometimes, we collaborate with restaurants to make the food and distribute to people every day, we get the restaurants, send money to them, they prepare the food and package it while the volunteers takes it and distribute to people,” he said in a chat with Nation. He explained, “When I posted online I saw a lot of people who wanted to volunteer but we needed sponsors first before volunteers. We also didn’t want to go against the government policy of staying at home and social distancing. We just organized volunteers and avoided any mistakes. If you watch our video you would see that we observed social distancing between people and between us.”
