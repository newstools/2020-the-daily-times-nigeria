For this year only, films available exclusively through streaming services will be eligible for awards at the Oscars. Under normal rules, a film must have been shown in cinemas in Los Angeles to be eligible, but the Academy has temporarily relaxed the criteria as the coronavirus pandemic has shuttered theatres. “Films that had a previously planned theatrical release but are initially made available on a commercial streaming or VOD service may qualify in the Best Picture, general entry and specialty categories for the 93rd Academy Awards,” a statement said, in part.
