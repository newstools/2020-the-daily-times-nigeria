The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Bauchi branch, says it is collaboration with health workers and the state government in sensitising its members on measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the state. Alhaji Saddique Ahmed, the state chairman, disclosed this on Thursday in Bauchi. Ahmed said the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic, globally, has necessitated the need of the leadership to mobilise and sensitise members against the spread of the deadly virus. “Each community needs sensitisation and mobilisation to prevent any outbreak of diseases; whether pandemic or not. “We have to mobilise all the local governments and wards’ leadership to mobilise their members on the policies that will curb the spread of the virus,” he said. He said the decision was necessary and part of the measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the state. The MACBAN chairman pointed out that members were sensitised on the physical distancing, hand washing and using of hand sanitizers. “We also urged members to report any symptoms of high fever and other unusual symptoms in the community. “You don’t know who has tested positive to coronavirus and you don’t know who has contracted it. “The best thing to do is take precautionary measures to safeguard our people and to halt the spread. “We have also directed that the herdsmen who are in the bush or forest should remain there,” Ahmed said.
