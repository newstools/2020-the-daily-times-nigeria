Award-winning Nigerian music producer, Larry Gaaga, has begun the production of the soundtrack of the remake of Amaka Igwe’s 1995 hit movie, ‘Rattlesnake’. Play Networks’ boss, Charles Okpaleke, bought the rights to ‘Rattle Snake’ five years after he acquired the rights to “Living in Bondage’’. This will be Okpaleke’s third movie. His first, “Living in Bondage: Breaking Free” made over N140 million within the first few weeks of its release in cinemas. Mr. Okpaleke revealed on Instagram that Larry Gaaga has been commissioned to produce the soundtrack for the upcoming movie ahead of its November theatrical release. He said: “this movie is coming to cinemas in November, but @larrygaaga is already working on the soundtrack. So apparently he comes up with 50 tracks, and during production and post-production he picks the top 12 to 15 tracks to match different scenes in the movie!”
