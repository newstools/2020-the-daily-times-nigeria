The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has set  up an independent COVID-19 Funds Monitoring Team to prevention of possible financial abuses that may arise in the management of the Covid-19 special intervention funds. This was contained in a statement by  Rasheedat  Okoduwa, Spokesperson for the Commission and made available to the Daily Times in Abuja on Tuesday. The ICPC said that the development is in the execution of its preventive mandate in Section 6 (b)-(d) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000. It said that the team will monitor the disbursement and utilisation of the funds, donations and other receipts mobilised towards combating the  outbreak of the Coronavirus in the country. The team will deploy appropriate strategy to prevent incidences of corruption that may have negative impact on the efforts of government to deal effectively with the pandemic and its work will complement the efforts of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 with regard to transparency and accountability in the management of the funds. While the commission salutes all those in the frontline of battling the outbreak and everyone facilitating the national effort behind the scene, it   reiterated its earlier advisory to all actors in the management chain of the COVID-19 response to steer clear of all unethical and corrupt acts that could result in criminal investigation and consequences.
