Speaker of Osun state House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye, has appealed to residents of the state to comply with the government’s extended lockdown order. The extended lockdown in the state is aimed at curtailing the spread of the coronavirus will commence on Friday. Owoeye, who was speaking at the plenary of the House in Osogbo on Thursday, said it was important for residents to abide by the rules of the lockdown so that the spread of the COVID-19 in the state could be contained. “The lockdown is a way to prevent community transmission of the COVID-19 disease and I believe if the extended 14 days extension is properly followed, it will help to contain and eradicate the spread of the virus in the state,” Owoeye said. He warned against politicising the COVID-19 pandemic, saying it was wrong to insinuate that the lockdown was to punish the people of the state. The speaker also urged residents to comply with government’s directives, adding that those caught flouting the stay-at-home order would be made to face the wrath of the law. Governor Gboyega Oyetola on Tuesday extended the lockdown in the state by another 14 days after the initial 14 days ended at midnight on Tuesday. Oyetola however, gave a two-day grace period for residents to restock for the lockdown, saying the 14-day extension would commence on Friday.
