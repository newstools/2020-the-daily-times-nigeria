Internationally bestselling author J.K. Rowling on Wednesday launched a new website showcasing content from her Harry Potter books in a bid to help stave off boredom for millions of children stuck at home. British author Rowling, 54, said her new platform “Harry Potter at Home” was aimed at children unable to go to school due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. The site includes links to free versions of the first in the Potter series, the 1997 novel “Harry Potter and the Philospher’s Stone,” available as an e-book or audio book in a range of languages.
