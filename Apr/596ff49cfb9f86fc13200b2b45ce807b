Due to resolution by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut its members production, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipreye Sylva, said Nigeria’s daily production would drop by almost 300,000 barrel per day. With this development, Nigeria’s
daily oil production capacity for the rest of the year will be significantly
below the revised volume of about 1.7 million barrels contained in the proposed
amended 2020 Appropriation Act. Based on the economic impact of
the coronavirus pandemic, the Nigerian government announced N320 billion cut
in its 2020 budget, to about N10.27 trillion against the N10.59 trillion
earlier passed by the national assembly and assented into law by President
Muhammadu Buhari. With the revised budgetary proposal, the crude oil price benchmark was reduced from the previous $57 per
barrel to $30, while daily oil production volume was sliced from 2.18 million
barrels to 1.70 million. However, with the resolution by
the OPEC to cut its members production, Mr Sylva, who was the head of the
Nigerian delegation to the meeting held online said Nigeria would now be
producing 1.412 million barrels per day between May and June 2020 in the first phase of the group’s agreement. He said between July and December
2020, Nigeria would produce about 1.495 million barrels per day in the second
phase of the agreement, and another 1.579 million barrels per day between
January 2021 to April 2022 in the third and final phase of the agreement. Despite the significant difference between the new OPEC output ceiling and the proposed production capacity in the 2020 budget, Mr Sylva expressed optimism Nigeria would still break-even and meet its revenue target.

 the OPEC on Friday resolved
to cut a minimum of 10 million barrels of crude oil production from its
production in an attempt to strengthen the oil market and halt the 
unprecedented decline in crude oil prices as a result of the impact of 
the
deadly Coronavirus pandemic. In the communique issued at the
end of the 9th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial meeting, its
Chairman, Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, said embers resolved to adjust downwards their
overall crude oil production by 10 million barrels per beginning from May 1,
2020, for an initial period of two months till June 30 2020. Mr Salman, who is also Saudi
Arabia’s Minister of Energy said part of the resolution at the meeting was for
members to also cut about eight million barrels per day subsequently for the
period of six months, between July 1, 2020, December 31, 2020. He said that would be followed by
another cut of six million barrels per day for the next 16 months, between
January 1, 2021, and April 30, 2022. While OPEC and non-OPEC oil
producing countries reaffirmed their commitment to the Declaration of
Cooperation to achieve and sustain a stable oil market, he said they also
resolved to uphold their mutual interest towards the efficient, economic, and
secure supply to consumers, and a fair return on invested capital. The Framework of the Declaration
of Cooperation was signed on December 10, 2016, and further endorsed in
subsequent meetings culminating in Charter of Cooperation signed on July 2,
2019, to cooperate towards a stable global oil market. The baseline for the calculation
of the adjustments, the OPEC Chairman clarified was taken to be the oil
production quotas of October 2018. The group agreed that Saudi
Arabia and Russia, the two powerful producers that stirred the recent global
oil war, were the only exceptions, with both agreeing to cut about 5.5 million
barrels each from their daily production. The agreement would be subject to
a review during the December 2021 meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring
Committee (JMMC) charged with the responsibility of monitoring the impact of
the decision.
