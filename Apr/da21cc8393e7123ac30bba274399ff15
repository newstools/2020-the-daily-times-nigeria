The Senator said he had directed that N5million should be given to the state’s COVID-19 committee, while another N5 million be given to the centrally coordinated COVID-19 food Initiative in the state. He also called on well-meaning indigenes of the state to complement the ongoing efforts of the Fayemi’s administration to curtail the spread of the pandemic. He added: “I, Sen. Opeyemi Bamidele has started by donating a sum of N10 million to fight the scourge. “Other federal lawmakers from Ekiti will definitely do something in a matter of days as well. “A sum of N5million has been paid into the State’s COVID-19 account while the remaining N5 million will go into the centrally coordinated food drive initiative specifically targeted at the vulnerable population in the senatorial district. “I am appealing to other illustrious leaders, sons, and daughters of Ekiti to join hands with the state government by contributing sacrificially to the COVID-19 account to augment what the government can mobilise. “The House of Representatives members and senators from Ekiti had since last week been distributing hand sanitisers, hand washing soaps, and buckets in their various constituencies.
