Identical twin sisters have died within three days of each other after both tested positive for COVID-19. Emma and Katy Davis, aged 37, had both worked as nurses and both had the same underlying health condition. Children’s nurse Katy Davis died at Southampton General Hospital on Tuesday while Emma, a former surgery nurse, died early on Friday. Katy had worked as risk and patient safety lead in child health, a spokesman for University Hospital Southampton (UHS) said. She had been unwell for a period before being admitted to hospital when she tested positive for COVID-19, the spokesman added. Emma, he said, had worked as a nurse in surgery in the colorectal unit from 2004 until 2013. The spokesman said: “She had the same underlying health condition as Katy and had been unwell prior to her admission when she tested positive for COVID-19. “She sadly also passed away last night and it goes without saying just how devastating and tragic this is for the family and all who knew them. “Emma has been described as an excellent nurse who was calm and cheerful and a good leader. She was well liked by all and was a valuable member of the team during her time with us. “We are supporting Katy and Emma’s family as much as we can through this difficult and distressing period.” Paula Head, chief executive at UHS, said: “Katy has been described by her colleagues where she worked in child health as a nurse people would aspire to be like and that nursing was more than just a job to her.
