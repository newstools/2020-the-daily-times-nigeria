Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) has extended the deadline for filing of Annual Returns for Individual taxpayers including self-employed persons for two months from April 1 to May 31, 2020. This decision was made in view of the coronavirus pandemic altering socio-economic activities around the world and as part of the on-going efforts to mitigate the effect on businesses and taxpayers. Statutorily, the filing of annual returns expires on the March 31st of every fiscal year and attracts stiff penalties for defaulters. With this extension as announced by LIRS, taxpayers are given a breather. COVID-19: Mark wants total battle against virus Chairman of Lagos State Internal Revenue Service Mr
