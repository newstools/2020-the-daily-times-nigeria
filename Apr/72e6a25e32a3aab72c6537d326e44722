Information reaching our news desk has revealed how pressure from president Muhammadu Buhari aide led to the sack of Kano State commissioner of Works and Infrastructure, Engineer Mu’azu Magaji. The Daily Times gathered that few hours after Magaji made the post on his verified Twitter handle, Bashir Ahmad, Personal Assistant on New Media to @BashirAhmaad responded  expressing  his disappointment. “I am really disappointed and pained by the Kano State Commissioner for Works, Engr. Muazu Magaji’s remarks on Mallam Abba Kyari’s demise, the commissioner was seen publicly celebrating the death on his Facebook page. I hope @KanoStateNG and @GovUmarGanduje will call him to order”. Magaji was immediately dismissed by Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje after his attention was drawn to the post. Recall that Governor Ganduje had sacked Engineer  Magaji for celebrating the death of late Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari. The Kano Commissioner was said to have taken to his Facebook wall and twitter to make indiscreet comments to celebrate the death of Kyari who passed away on Friday night from the coronavirus pandemic.
