The need to observe the directive by the Delta state Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, in adhering to the recommendations of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) have again been stressed. A community leader in Okpanam, Oshimili North Local Government Area of the state, Chief Andrew Okonmah, stated this in Okpanam while fielding questions from newsmen on the ravaging coronavirus pandemic. He lauded Gov. Okowaâ€™s efforts at curtailing the spread of the disease in the state, adding that it was a thing of joy to observe that the global disease has not spread to the state. Chief Okonmah, a business mogul decried the negative consequences of the virus, noting that though it was imperative to maintain all preventive measures, but that the few days of lockdown across the state has resulted in increased hunger. While calling on relevant government authorities to expedite action in providing prompt palliative measures aimed at cushioning the compounding effects of COVID-19, Okonmah however, appealed to the Okowa administration and other political leaders and well -to- do individuals in the state to embark on immediate distribution of food items, protective equipment and drugs to citizens of the state. Earlier, the Manager of Okonmah Investments and Business Initiative, Mr. Innocent Okonmah, lamented that the outbreak of the virus has crumbled all economic activities in the area as every shop visited was under lock and key. He commended the state governor for the various steps adopted to curtail the outbreak of the disease in the state and urged local businessmen and women , especially those dealing on essential food commodities and items not to unnecessarily take advantage of COVID -19 pandemic to hike the prices of their goods. He expressed optimism that scientists in the world would soon discover the cure for the disease and called on world economic powers to enhance synergy with each other to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic.
