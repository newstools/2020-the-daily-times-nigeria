Mixed reactions have greeted the Sacks of Kano Commissioner over celebrating Abba Kyari’s Death by  The Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje The Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba,  was removed following his unguarded utterances against the person of the late Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba Kyari. Reacting to the development on Twitter I agree with ur last statement but truth be said; once again it will humble alot of political class who don't want to help fix this country… Lol they fired him on Saturday they can't even wait till Monday Inside Nigeria everything is possible My governor is mr no nonsense We can deceive ourselves but not God. If truly Abba Kyari  deserve peace in heaven, may the host of angels reward him all the peace he caused in this Country.Can I hear an AMEN.
