A public health expert, Alhaji Kamaldeen Akintunde, has advised government to check the expiring dates and quality of food items donated by individuals and groups to support the vulnerable during the lockdown before distribution. Akintunde, also a Sanitation Expert, gave the advice on Thursday in an interview  in Abeokuta. He said that there was need to ensure foodstuffs and items, including the perishable were not expired products or had lost quality so as not to put beneficiaries of stimulus palliatives at risk. He said that unwholesome foods, groceries, expired, rusting and dented canned foods might inadvertently be donated or supplied at the risk of contracting bacterial and chemical food poisoning by innocent consumers. The public health expert said that consumption of food items that had expired or contaminated by rodents – like the black rats at storage, could give rise to bacterial, food poisoning and Lassa fever epidemics. He enjoined government to ensure early distribution to avoid contamination and food borne infections while still battling with the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. Akintunde also urged beneficiaries to ensure consumption of the foods or items within a reasonable period and before the expiring date. The expert also cautioned members of the public against adulterated and expired hand sanitisers and pro-life kits. He, however, advised them to ascertain from the label, the expiring date of such safety device before applying them. Akintunde charged the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) to be proactive and safe lives. (NAN)
