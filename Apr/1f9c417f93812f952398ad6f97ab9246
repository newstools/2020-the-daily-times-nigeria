The Daily Times recalls that there were reports earlier on Thursday that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had relaxed the the lockdown order. But debunking the report at an inter-ministerial press briefing on Update on COVID-19, the state Commissioner for Information, Gbenga Omotosho, said there was no truth in the rumour that Governor Sanwo-Olu had lifted the lockdown order. He said: “In the first place, the lockdown of Lagos State was not instituted by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu but by the Federal Government. So if it is to be lifted, the order will come from President Muhammadu Buhari who gave the order.” Omotosho urged Lagosians to continue to adhere to the stay-at-home order as the state government steps up efforts to combat the Coronavirus pandemic.
