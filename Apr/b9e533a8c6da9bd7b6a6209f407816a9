At least one person has died in a revolt by inmates at a Siberian prison, Russian state media reported on Saturday. The body was found in the rubble of a burned down building. Further information about the personâ€™s identity was not available. The prisoners who had escaped from their cells set fire to several buildings at the prison complex located in Angarsk, near Lake Baikal, on Friday. According to reports, the blazes were almost extinguished on Saturday and authorities had declared the situation to be under control. The Tass news agency, citing investigators, reported that violent clashes between security forces and prisoners had occurred. According to initial information, up to 18 prisoners were involved in the revolt. Some had reportedly feigned suicide in order to escape from their cells before attacking and injuring a guard. Prior to this, one of the inmates had been searched for a possible rules violation. He is said to have then called on others to revolt. According to reports, there were complaints from inmates at the penal colony about access to medical care. (dpa/NAN)
