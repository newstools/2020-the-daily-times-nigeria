MTV Shuga has been a fan favourite and one of the most innovative health-based and youth-focused shows in Africa for many years. The producers of the series are taking their commitment to the health and well-being of youths across Africa to another level with a new digital series. It is titled MTV Shuga: Alone Together. The aim is to flatten the COVID-19 curve and tackle the societal challenges from the pandemic. The series will bring together MTV Shuga casts from Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Cote d’ Ivoire. Each actor will self-record their roles from the safety of their homes. This will fit into how the story is being told – through video calls between the MTV Shuga characters.  Some of the MTV Shuga stars on this project include Jemima Osunde, Timini Egbuson, Tomiwa Tegbe, Nick Mutunma, and Lerato Walaza amongst others.
