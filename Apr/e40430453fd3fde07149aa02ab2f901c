The majority of Airbus sites in Spain have joined forces to produce 3D printed visor frames, providing healthcare personnel with individual protection equipment in the fight against Covid-19. More than twenty 3D printers are working day and night. Hundreds of visors have already been produced and dispatched to hospitals close to the Airbus facilities in Spain. Airbus leverages a patented design to manufacture the visor frames, using PLA plastics. Actor Ernest Asuzu recovers, thanks Mrs Obiano, wife of Anambra state governor “One of the reasons I
love my job is the capability we have for advanced design and quick
manufacture. Overnight, we have gone from making aerospace concepts to medical
equipment. This genuinely makes a difference in the fight against the pandemic
and I couldn’t be prouder of our teams working day and night on this Airbus
project,” said Alvaro Jara, Head of Airbus Protospace, in Getafe, Madrid. Despite the pause of the
majority of production at Airbus’ sites in Spain following the Royal Decree of
29 March, Airbus employees are allowed on site to continue with this essential
activity. In addition, Airbus in
Germany also joined the project. The Airbus Protospace Germany and the Airbus
Composite Technology Centre (CTC) in Stade, together with the 3D-printing
network named “Mobility goes Additive,” are now supporting this project in
Spain, also coordinating the collection and transport of visors to the Madrid
region.
