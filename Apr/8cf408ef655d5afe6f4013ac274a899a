The Anambra state Police Command says it has arrested four suspects, who allegedly posed as health officials to sell fake sanitisers and unhygienic face masks to members of the public in Onitsha. Police Public Relations Officer of the command, Haruna Mohammed, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Mohammed identified the suspects as Anthony Oyatubo (30), Nwachukwu Chidi (31), Chris Okeke (30) and Olisa Moura (25). “On March 31, at about 3pm following intelligence report, police operatives attached to Central Police Station, Onitsha, arrested members of a syndicate. “The suspects, who allegedly claimed to be officials of the state Ministry of Health were fully kitted with reflective jackets and caps with inscription: FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19. “They were arrested with flyers, hand sanitizers and face masks which they produced locally under unhygienic conditions and sold to unsuspecting members of the public and other outlets in Onitsha,” the police statement said. Mohammed said that preliminary investigation revealed that the suspects were neither government workers nor health officials as they claimed. The police spokesperson described the suspects as “misguided elements, who took advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to market their unhygienic products to oblivious buyers.” He said that exhibits recovered from the suspects include three cartons of hand sanitizers, flyers, several reflective jackets, four caps and over 50 face masks. According to Mohammed, further investigation will be carried out before the suspects are charged to court. He reiterated the warning of the state Commissioner of Police, John Abang, that members of the public should be wary of such syndicates and refrain from patronising them.
