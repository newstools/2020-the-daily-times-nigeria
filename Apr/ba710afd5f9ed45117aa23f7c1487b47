The Enugu state government has directed commercial tricycle operators in the state, to limit their operating time between 6 am and 7 pm daily. The Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prof. Simon Ortuanya, made this known in a statement made available to journalists in Enugu on Monday. He said that the directive takes effect from the evening of April 13. “The decision was in furtherance of the state government’s efforts to sustain its robust response to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the state as well as provide maximum security for residents. “The earlier executive order issued by the governor that every tricycle operator should carry a maximum of two passengers at a time remains in force. “Any tricycle operator found in contravention of the above directive shall be apprehended by the security agencies and dealt with according to the law,’’ Ortuanya said. The Association of Tricycle Riders Transport Union (ATRTU), Enugu state, had reminded its members about the directive of the state government that commercial tricycle operators in the state should be carrying two passengers only. The directive that tricycle riders should not operate beyond the state’s land boundaries is also still in force.
