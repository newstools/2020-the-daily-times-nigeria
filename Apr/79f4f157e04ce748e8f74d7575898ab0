The Presidents Cup has played a significant role in Trevor Immelman’s career. It stands to reason that taking on the role of a Presidents Cup captain is one of the most important things he’s ever done in golf. Immelman, just 40 years old, was introduced on Tuesday as the seventh man to lead the International team in the biennial competition, taking the helm from fellow South African native Ernie Els for the 14th edition of the Presidents Cup scheduled for September 2021 at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, N.C.

The U.S. rallied to defeat the Internationals, 16-14, at Royal Melbourne Golf Club and extend its winning streak to eight dating to 2005. The U.S. leads the series 11-1-1.  “It is going to be an amazing honor for me, and for my family and I to be a part of that,” said Immelman, who served as a captain’s assistant under Els in Australia. “The Presidents Cup and the PGA Tour [have] been a massive part of my career. And so for me to now lead the International team is something that really, it’s a speechless moment. It’s the highlight of my career and something that I can’t wait for.”
