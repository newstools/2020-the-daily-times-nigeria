…Says early detection, isolation only option to curb spread The World Health Organisation (WHO) special envoy, David Nabarro, has said that the coronavirus pandemic will remain in the world for quite some time. Nabarro also disclosed that early detection and isolation of positive cases remain the best way to curb the spread of the disease. Speaking during his appearance on a live TV programme, the WHO special envoy said that the virus will stalk the human race for quite a long time to come. While soliciting for cooperation between nations, he stressed the need to follow the guidelines to avoid spreading the disease. “We are not so sure it will come in waves in the way that influenza does. “We think it’s going to be a virus that stalks the human race for a quite a long time to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us. “The key for this particular virus is that every community has a kind of defensive shield, can pick up cases as soon as they appear, isolate them and stop outbreaks from developing. “It’s going to be necessary for every single country to have that capacity. We believe what we’ve got, we work with what we’ve got. That’s how we operate in the World Health Organisation. “We’re right in the middle of this massive, epic struggle. Every single human being in the world is affected by it. Businesses are really in trouble, communities are in distress. “I really do hope that all nations will not find any reason to make threats or other such things that will undermine our capacity to bring together all the best knowledge that we can find,” Nabarro asserted. The novel coronavirus which broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province of China in December 2019, has infected over 1.6 million people and claimed over 110,000 lives worldwide.
