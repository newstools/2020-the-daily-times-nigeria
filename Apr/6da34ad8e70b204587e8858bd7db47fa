Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, Director-General of NCDC, said this, on Thursday in Abuja, while giving an update on COVID-19 in the country. Ihekweazu said that was the more reason the Presidential Task Force held daily news briefing. “Please listen for updates. We can flatten the curve, if we join hands together,” he advised. The NCDC DG said that the agency had also updated list of State Emergency numbers. “If anyone requires testing they should contact their states through the listed numbers. “Provide relevant details e.g. travel history, and stay at home and wait for further advice,” he said.
