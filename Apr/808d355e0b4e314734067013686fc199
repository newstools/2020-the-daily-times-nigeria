UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, has made it clear that it wants its member associations to complete their domestic seasons rather than abandon them. It also hopes to finish the Champions League and Europa League competitions. UEFA said in a statement that the meeting, to be preceded on Tuesday by a session for the general secretaries of its 55 member associations, will “discuss the latest developments regarding the impact caused by the coronavirus outbreak on European football.” “The meetings will look at developments across both domestic and European competitions,” it added. Both will be held by video conference.
