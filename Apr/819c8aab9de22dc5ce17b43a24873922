Kwara State Government has received 1,800 bags of 50kg rice and 700 pieces of 25 litres of vegetable oil as its share of the Federal Government palliative to cushion the effect of Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The  commodities were received on behalf of Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prof. Mamman Saba Jibril, on Sunday in Ilorin. AbdulRazaq commended the federal government for the gesture which, he said, was meant for the most vulnerable in the society as the world battles COVID-19 amid lockdowns. “We are very grateful to the federal government for reaching out to the most vulnerable in our state at this time. “Specifically, we thank the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development for the gesture. “We assure Mr President that the palliatives will be delivered to the intended beneficiaries as we have been doing,” Jibril said. The SSG appealed to the people of the state to use the period of Ramadan to seek God’s mercy to end the coronavirus pandemic, “The situation at hand shows just how vulnerable we are and we must pray to God to save us even as we play our individual roles as explained by various health authorities,” the SSG added. Dr Abubakar Suleiman, the team leader from Abuja, said the palliatives “were being shared to the states on the order of Mr President for distribution to vulnerable groups in this time of global pandemic”. Suleiman said the palliatives comprised three truckloads of 1,800 bags of 50kg of rice and a truckload of 700 gallons of vegetable oil. (NAN)
