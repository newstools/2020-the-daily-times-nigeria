Some of them were conveying passengers on motorcycles and vehicles during the lockdown, using military uniform. “These are pure civilians using military uniform to commit crime. Some were using the military accoutrements for illegal duties, painting the military in bad image. We will continue this operation until we restore normalcy to the society. “The operation is also not necessarily for miscreants, but for our personnel too, who are misbehaving and carrying passengers. Nobody is permitted to use military stickers on their cars at any point in time. We the military don’t use the stickers again, so anyone using military sticker, accourtrements, will be arrested and where necessary handed over to the police. “Consequently, members of the Nigerian public are enjoined to be aware of such imposters who hide in military outfit to commit crimes. We also wish to inform the general public that most of those who posed in military outfits and carrying passengers on morticycles are not soliders or members of the Armed Forecs. The public are hereby advised to report any suspected person in military outlook, ” he said.
