continued its steady growth trajectory.” He cautioned
that, “while the results for 2019 showed very strong growth, the economic
headwinds of the last few weeks has moderated our growth expectations for the
next few months. It is expected that the economic and social impact of the
COVID-19 virus will be far-reaching. “As a Bank we
have also tried to play a role in supporting local and federal efforts in
providing relief to those impacted directly and indirectly. This “new
normal” has necessitated massive adoption of technology across the economy and
we are glad that we have stayed ahead of the curve and our previous technology
investments have continued to yield results. “ALAT, Nigeria’s
First Fully Digital Bank, continues to record strong performance as adoption
rates have grown and the customer base is almost at the half a million mark. We
plan to continue our growth in customer acquisition and retention despite the
headwinds.”
