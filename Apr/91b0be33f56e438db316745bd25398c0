Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi state has directed the state accountant general and other stakeholders in the payment of salaries to with immediate effect stop deduction of some percentages from salaries of workers as contributions to the fight against coronavirus. A press statement made available to journalists in Bauchi by the governor’s Special Adviser on New media, Alhaji Lawal Muazu, said his principal gave the directive on Tuesday at the inauguration of the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Committee. Governor Bala Mohammed said the directive was after receiving series of complaints by some categories of workers. “I was told by the Hhead of civil service and the organised labour in the state that workers will contribute percentage from their salaries to support our campaign against the spread of coronavirus, but later, some workers complained that the government forced them to contribute to fight coronavirus, which is not true,” part of the statement read. “With this development, I directed the accountant general and the head of civil service to stop deduction of any amount from the salaries of workers, whoever wants to contribute as part of corporate social responsibility can meet the State Task Force,” the governor noted. Governor Bala acknowledged the sacrifices and contributions from some citizens in the ongoing campaign on coronavirus, assuring that his administration will not force any of them to make compulsory contribution.
