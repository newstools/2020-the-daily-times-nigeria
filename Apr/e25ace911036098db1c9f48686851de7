As part of palliatives to cushion the effects of COVID-19, the Federal Government has commenced the disbursement of N20, 000 Conditional Cash Transfer to indigent households (poor) at the Kwali Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. This is part of the Federal Government’s efforts to help reduce the effect of President Muhammadu Buhari’s lockdown order following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.

She explained that the President during his broadcast last week directed that the conditional cash transfer should be given in advance of two months. “We have directed an immediate cash transfer to the poorest and most vulnerable households in the country,” she said. “Because of this COVID-19, the vulnerable groups have to expand, because we are aware that there are people who live on daily wage, so we are also going to look at those groups of people to see how we can get this food relief intervention to them in this period.”
