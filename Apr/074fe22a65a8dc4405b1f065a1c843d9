Despite the worries over the COVID-19 pandemic, the Benue State House of Assembly, (BSHA), on Tuesday resumed plenary with a call on members to limit the number of visitors they allow into the Assembly complex to prevent community transmission of the pandemic.

The Speaker commended members for abiding by the rules and regulations of government to stay at home, and for reaching out to their constituencies with palliatives to see that the Benue people stay safe and survive the Pandemic. “I am in deed overwhelmed by our collective sense of selflessness and I do hope and urge all of us never to get weary of this kind gestures,” he said. The Speaker stated that the 9th Assembly has only a few weeks to round up its first legislative session and charged all Committee with pending bills and reports to turn them in so that the session ends on the same sound note which they started.
