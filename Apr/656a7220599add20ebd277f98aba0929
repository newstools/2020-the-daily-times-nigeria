While reacting to the recent arrest of his colleague in Nollywood; Funke Akindele- Bello and her husband, AbdulRasheed Bello, for flouting the social distancing regulations; enacted by the Lagos State Government, Goodness Christopher Nnebechukwu, popularly known as Boss Goody, has revealed some of the lessons other celebrities should grab from that scandal. The Computer Science graduate from Open University of Nigeria stated that all celebrities should be very mindful of the overzealous fans as same set of people could lead to their downfall. “Funke and her husband’s case is something we all as celebrities should learn from. Those people you do giveaway for on social media and also call you role model are same sets of people that would drag you down at any slightest opportunity. In this life, we should not live our lives to please people. Do you and leave the rest. Not all fans want your progress,” he advised. Born in Jos Plateau State, Boss Goody started his entertainment career officially in 2015 when he released his first official single with visual title “Naija 4 Life”. He didn’t relent, but went out to express his acting skills when he was featured alongside Zack Orji and Ali Nuhu in a Movie titled “Mandika’s Glory”, since then he has featured in many other movies. He says, ”I have always known that someday, I would fulfill my dreams of becoming an actor, so last year, 2019, I summoned courage and gave it a shot and as they would say, the rest is history. It was not that easy though, interpreting roles but my background in music gave me all the courage I needed,’ he stated.
