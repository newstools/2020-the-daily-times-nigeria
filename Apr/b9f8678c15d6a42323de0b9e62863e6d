Juventus superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has been slammed for breaking the coronavirus lockdown rules after he was snapped playing football in Madeira. Ronaldo who has been in the forefront in urging people to stay home as medics work to find a solution is in his native Portugal but according to Lazio director of communications, Arturo Diaconale, the player’s recent behaviour is a sign of preferential treatment to the forward.

If the Prime Minister says that we can return to training after May 3, we will all start organising for that. “But the impression I have is that there is some favouritism. I am referring to the clubs to which their players are allowed to travel abroad, who will now return and do a quarantine period to return to training at the same time as those of Lazio. “The difference is that we followed the rules and stayed at home, unlike others; I’ve seen videos from Portugal showing some marvellous images of Cristiano Ronaldo training out on a football pitch. “Others have been able to train in peace abroad without restrictions, while we are not allowed to do the same in Italy.” Juventus currently top the Serie A table by a point from closest rivals Lazio.
