Enugu – The Methodist Archbishop of Enugu, Most Rev Christopher Edeh, has urged Nigerians not to be afraid of the ravaging Coronavirus but seek the face of God. In a sermon to mark the Palm Sunday in a radio church service in Enugu, Edeh urged the people to fear the Lord and not the pandemic. According to him, the Palm Sunday signifies celebration over fear and victory in the world, declaring Jesus as King over our lives. ”This period of pandemic, I urge the people not to be afraid but to trust in the Lord and ask Him for mercy,” he said. The archbishop appealed to Nigerians to comply with and respect all the hygiene directives of the government including regular hand wash, observing social distancing and staying at home. ”You should stay at home and join the church service online. You and I are the church, not the building.Those  who despise God now will face His wrath. ”All over the world, streets are empty, businesses are collapsing, there’s recession according to IMF as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. ”The only solution to the pandemic is seeking the face of God. The church will not fail at this time,” he prayed. Many church denominations in the state capital worshipped online while the usual procession of Palm Sunday was not observed. (NAN)
