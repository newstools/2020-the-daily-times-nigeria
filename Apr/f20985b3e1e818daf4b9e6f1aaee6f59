Following the death of his Chief of Staff, Mallam Abba Kyari as a result of COVID-19 infections, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council (OYC) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to appoint an Igbo politician as Kyari’s replacement as a proof of his claim to loving the Igbo race. The group also called on Buhari to “look inward, make amendments and clear doubts about his stance as the father of Nigeria” by appointing replacement from the Igbo speaking areas of Niger-Delta or South-East.

They also prayed to God to give Buhari the fortitude to bear the demise, grant Kyari’s soul mercy and forgive his shortcomings. OYC noted that there were capable and trusted allies of the president in the zone since his entrance into politics in 2003 till date. The group said an Igbo Chief of Staff will unite the country, end secessionist agitations in the South, add transparency to governance and ensure strategic stability of the economy. The statement read in part: “This is the most patriotic but rare opportunity for President Muhammadu Buhari to heal Nigeria from disintegration and collapse. In retrospect, it was an Igbo who masterminded the amalgamation of defunct political parties to merge into APC. “Buhari can rewrite history by being contradictory to predictions and prove his legitimate political sagacity through the appointment of an Igbo from anywhere as the new Chief of Staff, even from the opposition party.”
