Inside the hearse, a spray of light blue flowers were placed on the coffin, a nod to his support for reigning Premier League champions Manchester City. Only 10 family and close friends were allowed to attend the service because of the coronavirus pandemic. Syd Little, Eddie Large’s comedy partner for more than half a century, was among them, alongside his wife, Sheree.
