Egypt will halt its public transport service on Monday, which marks the annual springtime holiday, in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, state television reported. Egyptians traditionally go to seaside beaches or public parks on Sham al-Nessim, a popular festival dating back to ancient Egyptian times. This year’s festival comes as Egypt is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic. The Arab world’s most populous country has so far reported a total of 2,505 coronavirus cases, including 183 fatalities. On Monday, all public transport – including buses, trains and the Cairo underground – will stop to reduce overcrowding, the broadcaster reported, quoting Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli. Shopping centres will also be shuttered on that day for the same reason, he added.

Egyptian authorities have enforced a string of measures to stop the spread of the virus. They include a night-time curfew, a halt to international flights and the closure of all educational institutions as well as mosques. (dpa)
