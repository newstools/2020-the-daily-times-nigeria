He said: “This report is not only false and misleading but mischievous. It is a deliberate attempt to embarrass the Commission. “No insurance company is being compelled or forced to contribute to the COVID 19 fund. NAICOM only requested the support of insurance companies further to the agreement between her, the Nigeria Insurers Association (NIA) and the Nigerian Council for Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) for a coordinated effort towards making a consolidated contribution to the fund as an industry”. He noted. He urged the public to disregard the report as false.
