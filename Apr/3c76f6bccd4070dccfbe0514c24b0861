Abuja – President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Abuja sent his best wishes to Muslims in the country and all over the world as they begin this year’s 30-day fast, following the sighting of the moon. The president, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, congratulated the Muslim Ummah as they commence this year’s Ramadan fast. He said: “I congratulate all Muslims as they commence this year’s Ramadan fast which is depicted by self-denial, universal brotherhood, austerity and helping relatives and needy people.” President Buhari described Ramadan 2020 as a challenge, ”falling as it is in the period of the global pandemic, which has spread to more than 200 nations.” He noted that virtually all countries had been advising citizens to avoid large gatherings and have their prayers and meals (suhoor and iftar) individually or with family at home. “In this Ramadan period, the kind of socializing you are used to now risks spreading the Coronavirus,” the president added. The president enjoined the Muslim faithful to refrain from those Ramadan rituals and traditions such as group meals and congregational prayers that have been put on hold by Muslim religious authorities all over the world. Buhari also urged the Muslims to endure and not to use the Coronavirus as an excuse not to participate in the Ramadan fast, ”unless such abstention is warranted by the excuses clearly outlined by health and religious authorities”. The President wished Muslims in the country and the world over all the blessings of the holy month.
