The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to emulate the leadership style displayed by the Chadian President Idris Deby who personally led his troops to route out insurgents and freed Nigerian territories and soldiers held captive by terrorists in northern part of Borno State. According to the party, President Deby’s leadership by example has further triggered questions among Nigerians regarding the commitment and capacity of President Buhari, as Commander-in-Chief, to lead the fight against insurgency in Nigeria.

In a statement on Tuesday by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party berated Buhari for chosen silence at a time, when again, he needs to stand up and take action to assure citizens of their safety as well as efforts being made by his administration against the insurgents. The PDP urged the Buhari Presidency to learn from President Deby and show commitment in the fight against terrorism beyond speeches and empty press statements from the comfort of the Aso Villa. The party commended and immensely valued the sacrifices by the nation’s gallant troops who are risking their lives on harm’s way to safeguard Nigeria against the insurgents despite the daunting challenges they confront daily. The PDP also called on all Nigerians to remain vigilant and continue to pray for the nation at this trying time.
