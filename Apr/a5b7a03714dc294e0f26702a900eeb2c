As part of efforts to cushion the effect of the ravaging global pandemic COVID-19 on his constituents, the member representing Epe Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon Wale Raji has began the disbursement of cash grant of N5000 each to his constituents. Hon Wale Raji said apart from the legislative support the House has given to the Federal Government and the recent donation of their two monthsâ€™ salary to fight the pandemic, he came up with the cash grant to give economic succour to his constituents who in the last few days have not accessed their various sources of livelihood due to the lockdown order by the Federal Government. He said the gesture is apolitical and as such is not limited to the political class. He also made public his plan to support 500 women with grant to support their existing businesses that would have been affected by the pandemic when it subsides. 2 suspected cult members arrested for allegedly killing OPC member in Ogun Hon Raji urged his constituents to continue to obey the stay at home order, observe social distancing and continue to stay safe in order to ensure the pandemic is defeated on time.
