Barcelona manager Quique Setién says that he can’t wait for football to return so that his team can win big titles and so he can show off trophies “while walking with cows” in his hometown. Setien is a proud son of Liencres, a small town in Cantabria, Spain and he never fails to talk about the cows, a notable feature of the town.

If it’s both of them, even better,” he said. “Of course I dream about it, and strolling around in Liencres, with the cows, with the trophy, showing it off,” he joked. The manager said he wanted to remain at Barcelona as long as possible: “I have signed for one and a half years fixed, plus one more possible year, and the reality is that I hope to serve that one too, and even renew.”
