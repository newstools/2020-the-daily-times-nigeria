Brazil has for the first time recorded more than 400 coronavirus-related deaths in a 24-hour period. According to the Health Ministry, 407 people died from Wednesday to Thursday. Some 3,313 people have now died in total after contracting the virus in the largest country in South America. The number of infected people stands at nearly 50,000.
