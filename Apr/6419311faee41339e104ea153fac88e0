The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, whose baby son is named Archie, gave up their jobs as working royals at the end of last month, allowing them to forge new careers, earn their own money and spend most of their time in North America. Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, who have recently moved to the Los Angeles area after stepping down from royal duties, said on Monday they were looking to set up a new charitable organization called Archewell. In their last message before stepping down, Harry and Meghan said they would focus on their family for the next few months while developing a new future non-profit organization, having been forced to give up their previous SussexRoyal brand. Britain’s Daily Telegraph newspaper reported late on Monday that last month they had filed extensive trademark requests in the United States. READ ALSO  President Buhari congratulates Amb.

Since the fallout, the couple have spent most of their time in Canada but recently moved to the Los Angeles area where Meghan was raised and where her mother still lives.
