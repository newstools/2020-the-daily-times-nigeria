Popular Nigerian Comedian, Sidney Talker has tested negative for the coronavirus disease. Sydney announced this on his social media platforms today. My Test Results just got in from Lagos State Ministry of Health and thankfully it is NEGATIVE. To those who felt this was a PRANK or CLOUT CHASING, I have just one question " Why would I chase clout at the expense of my life ? " To everyone who prayed for me in my weakest moment and for quick recovery, I pray that on the day you are in distress may you also find help and recieve prayers IJN Amen I love you all & I promise I will be back and better soonest A post shared by  EGERE SYDNEY (@sydneytalker) on Apr 2, 2020 at 3:45am PDT
