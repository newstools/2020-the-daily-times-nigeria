signed by Aliyu Ahmed, Permanent Secretary, Finance (Special Duties), the
ministry said the evidence is required to enable it address the lingering
agitations from local government councils on the matter. The ministry, in the letter, sighted

would have on option but to recover the LGCs share through deduction at source
from the states monthly allocation”.

was instructed by Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) to
request for the payment of the portion of the Paris Club Loan Refund due to
LCGs into the states Joint Local Government Account of each state as provided
under Section 162 (6) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
1999, noting that it is alleged that many Local Government Councils across the
states have not been given the refunds due to them till date. It would be recalled that the
Federal Government early this year commenced probing the disbursement of
$2,626,092, 828.84 Paris Club Loan refunds due to Local Government councils in
the country. The state governors collected
$6,483, 282,424.61 refunds directly from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
based on the directive of the Minister of Finance. The money was meant for
states and the local government councils. The states’ share of the
$6,483, 282,424.61 was $3, 858,189,596.76, while the remaining belonged to the
774 councils. But in at least 30 states, it
has been difficult to trace the $2,626,092, 828.84 belonging the local
government councils, prompting the letter by the Finance ministry.
