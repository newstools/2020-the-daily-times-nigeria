The club said, “A second player does have the virus. He is fine and is recovering well.” This is a second case at the Premier League side, following the first case that was made public last week. During Thursday’s meeting, the three officials agreed to take wage cuts as a way of ensuring their non-playing staff unit is not affected. “[This is] to help Tony to ensure none of our core staff suffer a wage reduction during this uncertain period for our business, Graham Potter, Dan Ashworth and I have voluntarily taken a pay reduction for the months of April, May and June,” read part of the note from the club. Adding: “We consider ourselves to be very fortunate to be working for the best of clubs at the most of difficult times so it is entirely appropriate that we play a very small part in reducing the financial burden on Tony.” English premier League  clubs have been forced to cut on their monthly expenditures to balance their finances, which have been heavily hit by the Coronavirus pandemic.
