…As members start receiving alert from April 14, 2020 As part of relief package of its members, the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) has announced its decision to support its members with relief funds totaling N50 million during the COVID-19 lockdown. According to a statement from the CMO, members will start getting the relief fund from Tuesday, April 14. “Starting from Tuesday evening, thousands of musicians across the country would receive bank alerts as Anti-Corona Emergency Relief Distribution from COSON. The distribution is in reaction to the hardship and distress being faced by many musicians in Nigeria who have been affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the current lockdown which has also stopped entertainment activities across the country. “For the distribution, the COSON Board has approved the sum of N50 million to be shared amongst about 4,500 members on the society’s register as at May 19, 2019,” the statement read in part. Speaking on the development, COSON Chairman, Chief Tony Okoroji said: “I have personally received calls from several members of COSON who are desperate for immediate assistance of any kind. Other members of our Board have received similar messages. At a time like this, COSON must be responsible and responsive to the needs of our members and we should do everything we can to help them wade through these hard times. That is the very reason why COSON was set up. I am proud of the quick response of members of the COSON Board who showed great understanding that we must be our brothers’ keeper at a time like this. “Starting immediately, with the co-operation of the banks, each qualified member of COSON will receive a modest sum of eleven thousand naira in what we have termed Anti-Coronavirus Emergency Relief (ACER) General Distribution.
