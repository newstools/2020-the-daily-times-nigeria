The sequel to the 1986 Hollywood blockbuster “Top Gun” was supposed to be one of the biggest movies of this summer, but the pandemic has pushed its release to December. In “Top Gun: Maverick,” Tom Cruise reprises his role as elite but reckless Navy fighter pilot Pete “Maverick” Mitchell – but this time as a flight instructor. “I know many of you have waited 34 years. Unfortunately, it will be a little longer. Top Gun: Maverick will fly this December. Stay safe, everyone,” Cruise wrote on Twitter. The new US release date is December 23.

He made a surprise appearance at last year’s San Diego Comic-Con festival to announce the sequel and treat fans to a short trailer. The pandemic has shuttered cinemas across the globe, forcing studios to postpone big-ticket productions, including “Wonder Woman 1984,” “Fast & Furious 9,” “Ghostbusters: Legacy” and the latest James Bond film.
