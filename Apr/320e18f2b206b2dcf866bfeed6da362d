The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mr Kadafur was outraged after he discovered long queues of commercial and private vehicles coming from various destinations at the Njimtilo checking point. NAN also reports that the vehicles were, however, prevented from coming into the state capital. The deputy governor said that it was unfortunate that some people took the COVID-19 pandemic for granted, which explains why they were defying the lockdown. He warned that the government had ordered security agents to deal decisively with anyone who flouts the state government directives. Kadafur explained that the restriction measures were not put in place with intention to punish travelers and commuters but to protect the people from the dreaded global pandemic. “The reopening of the gate on Monday was done to allow those who did not get adequate information on the restriction order to come into the state. “That should not give room for continuous violation of the order,” he said.
