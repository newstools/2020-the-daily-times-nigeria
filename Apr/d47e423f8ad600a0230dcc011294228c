The Gunners have one of the largest wage bills in England at £230m and it is feared deferrals alone wouldn’t help their cause further down the line. Part of the problem for Arsenal has been their failure to qualify for the Champions League over the past few years, thus no money. A guaranteed £13.5m was paid to clubs who qualified for the Champions League last year while Arsenal received just £2.5m for reaching the Europa League group stages. For now, it seems the players will be asked to help keep the club afloat while also being expected to be ready to fight on the pitch to return to Champions League football, if the league returns. Arsenal sits 9th on the log.
