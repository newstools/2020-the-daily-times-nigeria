The Federal Inland Revenue Service says it is rolling out palliatives to cushion the effects of COVID-19 on Nigeria’s taxpayers. FIRS chairman, Muhammad Nami in a statement said that following the Federal Government’s lockdown of FCT, Lagos, and the Ogun States on 29th March 2020 as one of the measures to contain the spread of Coronavirus, it was important for FIRS  to remain committed to supporting the Taxpayers to continue to thrive even as the Service faces the pressure of generating increased tax revenue for the Government. Throughout the days and months ahead, we want to reassure you that supporting Nigeria’s diverse and dynamic businesses through this uncertain time is our topmost priority. The response to the current situation is evolving rapidly, with advice and guidance changing daily. In the meantime, FIRS has set up a number of measures to provide support to Taxpayers in managing their tax obligations as they are impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.
