Top 5 LGAs with Passengers of interest (POIs) are; Etiosa, Ikeja, Alimosho, Kosofe  and  Oshodi/Isolo. Covid-19 surveillance in Lagos so far targeted 2645 POIs, with 2,293 under follow up, while 352 POIs have exited follow-up (outside incubation period) Activation of ICS 4 weeks  prior to discovery of index case put Lagos on top of the situation. Thus far, after 4 weeks, it would appear that Lagos has FARED BETTER in managing the crisis, COMPARED with the situation in ITALY, IRAN and SPAIN that got into exponential phase after 3-4weeks. We are on the look out for local transmission as imported cases will drop significantly because of the closure of the airports. However, current trend indicates that COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION is NOT on the RISE yet. There are 3 testing sites in Lagos: IDH-Yaba, LUTHOfficial and NIMR. The Response team at LASG #COVID19 remain committed to aggressive containment measures against the spread of the virus. Every citizen is therefore enjoined to continue to observe social distancing.” Stay-at-home directive: Kwara residents lament effects ~
