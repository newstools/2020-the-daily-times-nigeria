About $1.3million worth of medical equipments and consumables have been donated to the federal government by a Chinese company working in Nigeria to help in the fight against the dreaded coronavirus pandemic. The donation also includes medical equipment and consumables, personal protective equipment (PPE) with over 1 million medical masks for health workers, and ventilators, amongst other items valued at over $1,300,000. The minister of health Dr. Osagie Enahire said in a statement that the resources will support the ongoing efforts of the health workers across the country, including doctors and nurses, who have been at the forefront of fighting the coronavirus. Dr Ehanire added that the PPE will also serve to protect these frontline workers and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the line of duty. He said that the Ministry on behalf of the Federal Government, appreciates the gesture from the Chinese community in Nigeria for recognising that collaboration, knowledge sharing, and expert insight are critical in the fight against coronavirus. “FMoH assures that the Federal Government, through the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), will ensure the quality of all the medical supplies that were brought into the country. “It must be stressed that, following global best practices and in line with our advisory, the medical experts from China have gone into isolation for 14 days and will be tested for COVID-19. “The Federal Ministry of Health will ensure proper distribution of the donations and strategic engagement with the medical team from China, to work with Nigerian medical experts. It is important to emphasise that the guests are not here to treat patients but to conduct capacity building based on their experience. “All available resources shall be deployed to support adequate engagement of Nigerian medical experts towards curbing the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria”, the minister stated.
