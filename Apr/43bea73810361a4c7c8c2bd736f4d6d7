Some fans think it’s selfish of Oprah Winfrey not to spare some of her billions to those affected by COVID-19. If these CRIMINALLY WEALTHY celebrities have nothing else, they have the fucking audacity. How dare they ask the general public to come outta their pockets for this clout-chasing charity stream. People are broke, sick, and unemployed. Can #Oprah not spare a crumb of her billions? https://t.co/tB4aUb3LMh
