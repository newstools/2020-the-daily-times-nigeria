Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has approved special e-portals that will allow Lagos State tertiary institutions commence online lectures as part of measures to reduce the impact of Coronavirus on education. A statement signed by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Education, Tokunbo Wahab, on Friday, said the seven schools that will benefit from the initiative are: Lagos State University (LASU), Lagos State Polytechnic, Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education, Michael Otedola College of Primary Education, Lagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM), Lagos College of Health Technology and Lagos State College of Nursing and Midwifery.

ensure physical distancing among students and their lecturers. The move will
also help in the maintenance of the State’s tertiary academic calendar despite
the COVID-19 pandemic. Wahab urged all students to maximise the unique
opportunity to keep themselves engaged while the lockdown arising from the
pandemic lasts, adding, “our special thanks must go to Mr. Governor for this
approval and for making Lagos the pacesetter among 21st century
knowledge-driven societies”.
