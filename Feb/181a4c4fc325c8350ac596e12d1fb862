The competition will run until June 2020. The winner of the show is expected to be gifted an apartment, fully furnished and fitted with studio equipment, a car and prize money. The show seeks to groom musical talent by providing a lifetime opportunity to turn their dreams and aspirations into reality. Since 2006, through the MTNF/MUSON Scholarship Programme, MTN Nigeria has trained hundreds of young Nigerians in the art and business of music. Y’ello Star takes this further by bringing the process of creating the ultimate superstar to every Nigerian television screen.
