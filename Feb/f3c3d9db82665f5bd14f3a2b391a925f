The Philippines’ flag carrier, on Friday, laid off 300 workers in a bid to manage losses sustained from travel restrictions due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus and its associated disease, the company said. Philippine Airlines (PAL), says it completed a “voluntary separation initiative for long-serving employees and a retrenchment process’’ involving ground-based administrative and management personnel.
