Software giant, Microsoft, has brought Lition blockchain solution to its Azure cloud marketplace, making Lition one of the few public/private blockchains currently supported by a major cloud provider like Microsoft. Microsoft also became the first to bring blockchain to the cloud and continues to remain at the cutting edge of blockchain adoption. According to Dr Richard Lohwasser, Lition’s Chief Executive, Lition is committed to providing an accessible onramp to blockchain for all organisations, adding that making integration as seamless as possible is vital to bridging the gap adoption, Cointelegraph reports. On his part, Lition marketing manager Benni Woerpel says synergies between big companies and startups are crucial for the blockchain industry and real businesses, noting that streamlining the processes to adopt blockchain technology through Microsoft Azure gives  a great advantage when approaching businesses. He adds that the challenge is to give simple solutions for complex corporate systems. Azure cloud currently has the second-largest share of the $229 billion public cloud market, primarily catering to large enterprise clients. Azure’s clients include over 95 per cent of Fortune 500 companies, including Walmart, Coca-Cola, Boeing and Samsung. Microsoft backed Azure cloud services platform has entered into several strategic partnerships in recent times to strengthen its network capacities. Recently, LucidLink, a highly acclaimed cloud file service solution, announced that its Filespace cloud-native file system had integrated Microsoft Azure Blob storage. The collaboration aims to provide data access to any cloud service provider in a convenient manner.
