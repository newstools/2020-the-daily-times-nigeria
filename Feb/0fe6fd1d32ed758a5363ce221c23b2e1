The United States has applauded the recent United Nations’ sanctions against the Islamic State in West Africa (ISIS-WA) and ISIS-Greater Sahara (ISIS-GS). Morgan Ortagus, Spokesperson of the U.S. Department of State, said in a statement on Wednesday that the move was a necessary step in the global fight to defeat ISIS.

In a statement, the committee announced its decision to add ISIS-WA and ISIS-GS to the ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List. The sanctions come with assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo under paragraph 1 of the Security Council resolution 2368 (2017). It coincided with reports that al-Qaeda and ISIL-linked groups were joining forces to take control of territories across West Africa. Ortagus said ISIS affiliates around the world remained a “significant terrorist threat including in Africa”, in spite of the complete liberation of ISIS-held territory in Iraq and Syria. She said the international community must work together to cut off their sources of funding, arms and other resources. “ISIS-WA is responsible for killing hundreds of innocent civilians in dozens of attacks since its inception in 2015. “ISIS-GS has also carried out numerous attacks since its formation in 2015, including the October 2017 attack that killed four U.S. soldiers in Niger. “This UN designation obligates all member states to implement an arms embargo, a global travel ban, and asset freeze on ISIS-WA and ISIS-GS, actions that will cut the groups off from the resources they need to continue their terrorist activities. “The United States remains fully engaged with our African partners to address security challenges and to advance peace and security on the continent,” she said.
