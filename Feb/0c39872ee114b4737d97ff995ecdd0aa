We are not directly or remotely involved in the act. We condemn insinuations that the Edo State Government is in any way involved in such an act.   “The series of anti-Oshiomhole protests across the country in the last couple of days, including those who jeered and booed Comrade Oshiomhole in Benin City, on Saturday have nothing to do with the government in Edo State. Oshiomhole, just like any other law-abiding person is welcome into the state as long as he does not engage in any activity capable of disrupting peace and safety.    “We categorically state that we are not in whatever guise involved with those who engaged in the act against the former governor.”   He stressed that the state government will continue to maintain law and order, adding that the government is committed to protecting the rights of all law-abiding citizens in the state.
