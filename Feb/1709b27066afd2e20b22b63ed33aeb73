A club statement read: “The President Urbano Cairo and the coach Walter Mazzarri, after an in-depth analysis on the set of situations that have now arisen, shared the decision to end the professional relationship early. “The club wishes to thank the coach and all of his staff for the commitment, fairness, and professionalism shown in these last two years.” The appointment of Longo, a former Torino player, follows a run of four straight defeats in all competitions and will be his second managerial position in Serie A, having previously managed Frosinone. Marrazzi, who led Torino to a seventh-place finish last season, previously managed Premier League side Watford during the 2016/17 season.
