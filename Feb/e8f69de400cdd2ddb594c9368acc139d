President Muhammadu Buhari condoles with the family, friends and all lovers of vintage highlife music as played by Dr Victor Abimbola Olaiya, who passed on at 89. The President notes that the highlife maestro, known for his mastery of the trumpet, brought joy and delight to people across generations, with his songs which were both entertaining and didactic. According to President Buhari, “His place in history is guaranteed. He sang, not just for the entertainment value, but also taught critical lessons on life, good neighbourliness, and national cohesion. He will be sorely missed.” He urges the younger generations of musicians to learn a lesson from Olaiya, so that their songs can also remain evergreen, and outlive them. Kaduna evacuates 90,000 tonnes of refuse in 2019 Noting that the departed musician’s works transcended Nigeria, the West Coast, and, indeed, the African continent, the President prays God to rest Olaiya’s soul, and comfort all those who mourn him. Olaiya died at the age of 89, after a brief illness on Wednesday afternoon at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). The “Baby Jowo” crooner retired from his musical career in 2017 and had some hit tracks like: “Omopupa”; “Jemila”; “So fun mi”; “Tina Meta”; “Pambotoriboto”; “Aigana”; “Odale Ore”; “Mo Fe Muyan”; Opataritius”; “Omolanke”, among others.
