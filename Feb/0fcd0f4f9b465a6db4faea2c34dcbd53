U.S. applauds UN sanctions on ISIS-West Africa Tsai said she ordered the secretive National Security Bureau to declassify its political files within one month. “Except for a few documents which cannot be declassified for legal reasons, the NSB must finish declassifying these files within one month,’’ Tsai said. Four decades of martial law rule under Chiang’s KMT regime followed the so-called February 28 Incident, during which thousands more were executed or imprisoned.
