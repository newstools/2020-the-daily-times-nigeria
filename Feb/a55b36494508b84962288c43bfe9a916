Fresh
 crisis may have hit the Burutu chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party 
(PDP) in Delta State following the alleged breach of existing agreement 
by the party stakeholders in the area. While  the party in the area might be in disarray if urgent steps are not  taken to pacify the aggrieved members, a chieftain of the party in ward  9, Mr Anthony Ebionmo at the weekend while speaking with Journalists,  raised the alarm on what he described as” breach of existing agreement”  by a few leaders to impose one Ebike Oromoni to continue as the party  chairman in the council area against the ongoing system. FCTA warns residents against illegal trade in wildlife products He
 warned that if the leadership of the party failed to nip the situation 
on the bud, PDP in the council would head for a serious crisis alleging 
that a stakeholders’ meeting was called by the council party Secretary 
on Saturday in Burutu as what they witnessed was different from the 
existing agreement, adding “before we got there what we saw was the 
endorsement of the incumbent party chairman, Ebike Oromoni by some party
 leaders which has never happened in the party.” “PDP
 in the council area has unwritten agreement that if the council 
chairman is coming from Burutu North, the party chairman must not come 
from Burutu North, the party chairman must come from Burutu South and 
Vice versa and that agreement stands till today.”
