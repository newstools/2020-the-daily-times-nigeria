On Jan. 20, Fakhfakh, who was at that time the finance and tourism minister, was commissioned by President Kais Saied to form a government. This followed just after the parliament resoundingly rejected a government of independent technocrats formed by then-prime minister Habib Jemli. Unhappy with the political classes, many Tunisians had voted for Jemli in elections last October. Tunisia was the birthplace of the Arab Spring in 2011. In spite of democratic reforms being introduced since then, the country is still struggling with great economic difficulties and civil unrest.
