Following Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele injuries La Liga have given Barcelona the go ahead to sign a striker outside of the transfer window. Barcelona have made former Middlesbrough forward Martin Braithwaite their No 1 striking target after ending their interest in Real Sociedad’s Willian Jose.

Braithwaite has a £15m release clause in his current contract at 19th-placed Leganes, who are keen to keep him as they attempt to avoid relegation from La Liga. The 28-year-old Denmark international would only be eligible to play in La Liga, with Barcelona having already submitted their squad for the knockout phase of the Champions League. Braithwaite endured a difficult two-year spell at Middlesbrough, scoring only nine goals in 36 Sky Bet Championship appearances. Barcelona have also shown an interest in Getafe striker Angel Rodriguez. The 32-year-old – who spent a spell on loan with Real Madrid’s B team – has a £7.5m release clause.
