A Magistrates’ Court in Makurdi on Monday ordered that a farmer, Saater Oraduen, charged with illegal possession of firearm, be remanded in a correctional facility, pending legal advice. Magistrate Ajuma Igama, did not take the plea of Oraduen because her court lacked  the jurisdiction to hear the case. My wife is quarrelsome, pours water on me while sleeping – Man tells court Igama ordered that Oraduen be remanded at the Federal Correctional Centre Makurdi and adjourned the case untill Feb. 24 for further mention. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Sgt. Ato Godwin, told the court that Oraduen was arrested by the Joint task force, led by LT. A. I Gidado in Katsina- Ala, Benue.

The team, he said, arrested Oraduen, who resides in Katsina-Ala L.G.A, Benue, with a locally made pistol. During police investigation,  he said, the suspect allegedly confessed to the crime and gave out the name of his accomplice, one Terpase, currently at large. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of sections 6(b) and 3(1) of the Robbery and Firearms Special Provisions Act, 2004. (NAN)
