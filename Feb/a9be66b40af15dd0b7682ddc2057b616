He noted that policies on higher education have been inconsistent, thus stifling the desired drive to make the country a knowledge based society. Ashafa said KASU’s target is to ensure that its programmes and researches create a knowledge based society, where knowledge is driving the economy. The deputy vice chancellor disclosed that the university had signed a memorandum of understanding with the University of Science in Malaysia to train its staff to handle the new courses. “The staff would obtain postgraduate diplomas and even degrees on higher education so that we can make our curriculum robust to stand the test of time.
