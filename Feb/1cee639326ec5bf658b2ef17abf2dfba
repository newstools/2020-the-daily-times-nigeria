Rome – Italy’s football governing (FIGC) has asked FIFA’s rule-making body, the International Football Association Board (IFAB), if it can make some changes to the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system. FIGC wants to introduce a system where Serie A teams can challenge referee’s decisions and ask for technology to intervene. The Italian top-flight introduced the VAR system in 2017/2018.

Napoli and Parma fumed over VAR last weekend for wrong calls made by the referee after they were not awarded penalty kicks. The FIGC believes managers should be allowed to challenge decisions, much like tennis players do with close line calls. The FIGC said it received requests from a number of Serie A clubs and they informally took up the matter with FIFA. It said it told FIFA they were ready to experiment with the use of challenges within a timeframe and process specified by IFAB. IFAB will hold its Annual General Meeting in Belfast on Feb. 29 where subjects such as possible future developments on VAR use and concussion protocols will be discussed. FIGC president Gabriele Gravina has also advised Serie A’s head of referees Nicola Rizzoli on this matter. Rizzoli is to instruct referees to make more use of on-field reviews for controversial calls as the title race heats up in Italy. Inter Milan and Juventus are tied at the top of the standings on 54 points while Lazio are third, one point behind.(Reuters/NAN)
