Esther Bishen, had told the court that one Akuna Emmanuel reported the matter at the divisional police station, Kafanchan, on Feb. 3. Bishen said the complainant alleged that the suspect trespassed into his house and attempted to steal some property and was caught. When the charges were read to him, he pleaded guilty and begged the court for leniency, but failed to produce any character witness. The prosecutor, thereafter, prayed the court to try him summarily in line with Section 125 (8) of the Criminal Justice Law of Kaduna State.
