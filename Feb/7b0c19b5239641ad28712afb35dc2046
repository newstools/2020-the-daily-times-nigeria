 Okitipupa Local Government Area of Ondo on Wednesday says it will sanction youths using cenotaph in the area as hideout for drug abuse. Mr Abayomi Adesanya, the council’s Caretaker Chairman, who stated this in Okitipupa when members of the Nigerian Legion paid him a courtesy visit, said that the cenotaph must not be abused. “The cenotaph is an historical ground that must be preserved because the labour of the fallen and standing heroes must not be in vain.

Adesanya said that it was imperative for security agencies to work together to checkmate issues of insecurity in the area and the state. The council boss said that his administration would ensure that drug abuse, stealing, kidnapping and other criminal acts in the area were reduced. “Efforts are in place to review the security architecture of the council, with the help of security agencies to reduce security breaches in and around the council. “I appreciate the synergy that exists among security agencies, especially the Nigeria Army and Police, but we want more synergy for our council to be a safe haven for all,” he said. Chief Ola Aiyeku, the Life Chairman of the Nigerian Legion, Okitipupa branch, thanked Adesanya for his commitment to providing adequate security in the area. Aiyeku said that the Nigerian Legion was willing to work closely with other security agencies. He urged the council to put a gate at the entrance of the cenotaph, deploy some of its staff to watch over and keep the environment clean at all times. Aiyeku also advised Adesanya to hold the yearly Armed Forces Remembrance thanksgiving service at the Nigerian Army, 19 Battallion Barracks in Okitipupa, instead of the usual church service.
