DPR reiterated that the initiative is in alignment with government ease of doing business policy which is geared towards economic growth. The initiative comprises amongst others, the following licences and permits, Retail Outlet Monitoring (ROMS) license for kerosene peddlers, Retail stations and industrial consumers, Import/Export Permit (IMPEX) for Petroleum products, Coastal Vessel Licence (CVL), Lube Oil Blending Plant Licence (LOBL), Depot Licence (DL), Refining Processing Licence (RPL). “WIth the  Automated downstream system in place,  the DPR no longer accepts manual processing of downstream applications as all applications for licenses and permits have been migrated to digital platforms,” they averred.
