It doesn’t sound like he has many apps or uses the customizable memojis on his iPhone, he says he simply uses it “as a phone.” Berkshire owns around 5.6% of Apple (AAPL). “You’re looking at an 89-year-old guy that’s barely beginning to be with it,” Buffett said. Although he’s been given “several” iPhones over the years, including from Apple CEO Tim Cook, he hasn’t used any of them as his personal phone until now. Buffett’s new iPhone is not his first Apple gadget: He previously said he uses an iPad to check stocks. He even sent his first tweet from an iPad in 2013. Buffett’s old phone was a Samsung SCH-U320.
