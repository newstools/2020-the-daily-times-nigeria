Borno booing: Learn lessons, stop chasing shadows, PDP tells Presidency According to IATA, full-year 2019 capacity climbed 3.4per cent, and the load factor rose 0.7 percentage point to a record high of 82.6per cent. The previous high was 81.9per cent set in 2018.  December 2019 RPKs increased 4.5per cent against the same month in 2018.

Juniac said “Airlines did well to maintain steady growth last year in the
face of a number of challenges. A softer economic backdrop, weak global trade
activity, and political and geopolitical tensions took their toll on demand.
Astute capacity management, and the effects of the 737 MAX grounding,
contributed to another record load factor, helping the industry to manage
through weaker demand and improving environmental performance”,
