He congratulated Egwunyenga on his emergence as vice chancellor, adding “I must appreciate all of you for the solidarity and I congratulate you on your emergence as the Vice Chancellor of DELSU. “I am aware that you understand the level of challenges on your table and should work to ensure that those who will leave the university will gainfully employ themselves and be innovative,” he said. The governor said that for the Vice Chancellor to succeed, the academic community and the non-academic staff must cooperate with him. Earlier in his speech, Egwunyenga thanked God for his appointment and appreciated the governor for considering him worthy of the position. He also commended Okowa for his commitment to the development of the university and the state as a whole.
