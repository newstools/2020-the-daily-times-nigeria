Declaring its support for the party’s demand for the review of the Supreme Court rulings, the caucus said it predicated its action on the request by the All Progressives Congress (APC) asking the Supreme Court to review its judgement on the Bayelsa governorship election. “We take cognizance of the fact that some Supreme Court justices and indeed, other judges as well as judicial officers have in the past suffered assaults, both formally and informally under the supervision of the Genera Muhammadu Buhari administration. “Cognizant of the fact the Supreme Court infallibility is hinged on it’s finality, and not because it’s personnel (justices) are infallible, we reaffirm our faith and confidence in the judiciary, particularly, the Supreme Court which is still the only hope of the common man. “Consequently, we express our unalloyed support for the leadership of our great party, the PDP, and hereby call for a review by the Supreme Court of all its earlier judgements,” the caucus declared.
