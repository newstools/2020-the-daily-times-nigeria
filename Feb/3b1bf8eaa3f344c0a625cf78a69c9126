The
Enugu State Government has debunked reports on social media alleging it is
constructing an Islamic Centre in Uwani, Enugu. In a
statement by the Commissioner for Information, Nnanyelugo Chidi Aroh, the state
government described the allegation as “unfortunate, malicious, wicked and
false”, stating that “there is no truth in the said story”. The
information commissioner added that “the story is only aimed at distracting the
state government from its widely acclaimed determination to deliver massive
infrastructural development and good governance to the people of Enugu State”. Aroh pointed out that the state government, in keeping with its commitment to open and transparent governance, always “abides by strict due process in the approval of any government project and expenditure”. We must work for Nigeria, not personal interests Buhari warns He
said the people of the state are briefed regularly on projects the state
government approved for execution as well as the financial value of such
projects, such as the recent approval for the construction of a modern
Christian Worship Centre in the Government House Enugu, “the first of its kind
since the creation of the old Anambra State”. According
to him, “while the state government will continue to respect the right to
freedom of thought, conscience and religion as guaranteed by Section 38 of the
Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, we urge all these agents
of mischief and falsehood to join hands with the government in its widely
acclaimed effort to improve the standard of living of the people of Enugu State
and continue the massive road construction and infrastructure works. “These
include the New Secretariat Building in Nsukka, the Unity Park/garden, the road
network at the New Golf Estate Annex, and the unique efforts to provide
security and protect lives and property in line with the oath of office which
obviously has resulted in the provision of vehicles, motorcycles, modern fire fighting
vehicles and equipments and the procurement of rapid response vehicles in the
State”. While
calling on the public to disregard the false allegation, the commissioner
maintained that “the state government will continue to do all within its powers
to ensure positive development in the state and encourage harmonious
co-existence of all residents”.
