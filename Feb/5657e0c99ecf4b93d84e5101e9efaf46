The governing board of the National Examinations Council (NECO) has
approved the dismissal of 19 staff from service for certificate forgery. According to a statement made available to the Daily Times by NECO Head, Information and Public Relations
Division, Azeez Sani, the council at its 52nd regular meeting with
the governing board of the council vetted the report of the certificate verification
committee and approved the dismissal of the affected staff. ‘’A staff certificate verification committee constituted by the management carried out its assignment diligently by inviting some staff with questionable credentials to appear before it, during which the affected staff attested that their certificates were forged. SERAP decries Reps’ granting immunity to principal officers ‘’The committee also contacted the schools and institutions which the
affected staff claimed to have attended and the schools and institutions denied
having certificated them,’’ the statement stated. It would be recalled that the governing board had at its 17th
extra -ordinary meeting in November, 2019, also approved the dismissal of 70
staff for certificate forgery. The certificate verification exercise which is on-going is aimed at
sanitizing the system.
