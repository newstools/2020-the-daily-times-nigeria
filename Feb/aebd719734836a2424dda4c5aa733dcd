NAN reports that the Court had nullified the All progressives Congress (APC) victory of Nov. 16 governorship election that brought in David Lyon. The supreme court had ruled that Lyon’s Deputy, Degi Ereminyo, submitted forged certificates which disqualified the joint ticket and nomination. The court urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to withdraw the certificate of return issued to them and reissue same to the next party with the required constitutional spread.
