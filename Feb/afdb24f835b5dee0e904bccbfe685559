Meanwhile, Bong paid tribute to his country in his speech saying: “We never write to represent our country, but this is very personal to South Korea.” He added that he was “very ready to drink tonight until next morning”. Jeongmin Kim, Seoul correspondent for NK News, responded with: “Okay we should all really break out all the soju and makgeolli [Korean alcoholic drinks] to celebrate with Bong.”
