He then made a comparison with one of the club’s best players of all time in Eden Hazard, who moved to Real Madrid last summer. “And then because of what Eden Hazard did for them, they had one particular player who in that role could make something happen. “I think it’s a brilliant signing. If he can hit anywhere near the form [he’s shown for Ajax] it’s a fantastic signing.” The 26-year-old will become Frank Lampard’s first Chelsea signing since taking over reins last summer. Since the 2012-13 season, Ziyech has made 217 Eredivisie appearances, scored 79 goals and contributed 87 assists.
