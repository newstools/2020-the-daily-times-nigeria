They added another four in the second period and would have scored more, but for many fluffed opportunities. Kwara BSC captain, Emeka Ogbonna, however scored a solitary goal for his team to end the second period 1-8. The Abuja team’s dominance was total in the first two periods, so much that Kwara BSC twice substituted their goalkeepers in a bid to plug their bleeding defence. However in the third period, the FCT-based club took their foot off the pedal and allowed Kwara into the game through Ogbonna and Usman Yusuf. The captain added two more goals to complete his hat-trick and Yusuf contributed some late efforts to reduce the deficit. It ended 10-5 in favour of Abuja BSC, who have now scored a total of 19 goals so far in the tournament. They will on Sunday in the final match of the tournament face Kebbi BSC, who earlier thrashed Badagry BSC 8-3.(NAN)
