CACOL in a press release issued and signed by its
Coordinator for Research and Documentation, Mr. Okechukwu Ndiribe on behalf of
the Executive Chairman, Mr. Debo Adeniran, praised Justice Okon Abang for
exhibiting what it described as courage in the delivery of the verdict despite
the various tricks deployed by the defendant to delay his trial. According to the anti-corruption advocacy group, “The
conviction and sentencing of Olisa Metuh who was the spokesman of the former
ruling party is another clear signal that corruption in high places can no
longer be condoned in our society, especially in the face of the widespread deprivation
which the masses of this country have been subjected to by corrupt elites.” He continued: “It was clear that Metuh was afraid for his fate for as long as the trial lasted hence his penchant for resorting to diversionary tactics like appearing in court on stretcher to curry public sympathy.

about the nature of the special assignment which necessitated the transfer of
the said N400m to him from the Office of the former National Security Adviser (NSA),
Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd.).” The CACOL boss further stated that Metuh’s conviction should
serve as a deterrent to all public office holders to desist from lining their
pockets with public funds as the day of reckoning could come sooner than they
expected. He also called for speedy trial of the former NSA, Dasuki
and all other public officers currently standing trial over sundry corruption
offences.
