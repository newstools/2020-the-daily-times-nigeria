As part of efforts in reducing financial exclusion in the
country, Carbon, a digital financial services company, has introduced a USSD
service to its platform, making it easier for individuals to access financial
services. This new service will allow existing Carbon customers to
access instant loans and other payment solutions via USSD without requiring
internet data. Prior to the launch of the USSD channel, Carbon’s financial
services were only available to smartphone users via its Android and iOS apps. Carbon is also launching simplified transaction processes for
the new USSD functionality, that is faster and easier to use. Using the USSD
code *1303#, customers (on MTN and 9Mobile) will now be able to quickly
transact, encouraging more financial inclusion and making access to financial
services possible in the absence of internet connectivity. Meanwhile,  mobile phone penetration continues to rise on the continent, providing a platform for much-needed fintech innovation, but  the high cost of internet data and the prevalence of feature phones  means many are still excluded from the benefits of mainstream financial services.

allowing it to deliver innovative financial services to a wider range of
consumers and giving them easier, quicker access to the funds and services they
require to fulfil their needs. “One of the biggest
selling points of USSD is that it works with or without the internet, which is
reassuring in the African context where internet data is expensive and
inconsistent. “As fintech continues to develop across Africa, and ingrains
itself into people’s everyday lives, it is important to invest and innovate
across the ecosystem”, CEO and co-founder, Carbon, Chijioke Dozie said.
