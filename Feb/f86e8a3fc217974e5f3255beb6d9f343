Tdot posited that although it is good to set out a day to celebrate love, it is more rewarding to show love in our daily interactions. ‘‘On Valentine, I am not sure what to make of it because it’s a Western idea which wasn’t popular until recently. ‘‘It is a good thing to have a day to celebrate love, but for me everyday should be about the show of love to fellow human beings. ‘‘For me, the day is an excuse to relax with my wife and send some gifts to my mum and siblings. ‘‘But of course I will not forget my friends as well,’’ he said. The vocalist said that he has started plans to launch his solo music career. ‘‘I am sorting out my plans before the rains begin. I will be having shows at the end of the month though,’’ he said.
