Cross River state capital. An associate
professor with the University of Calabar, Dr. David Ugwu, was abducted at his home
on Friday evening, while a staff of the state newspaper corporation, Morris
Archibong, was kidnapped on his way home on Saturday. Prof. Ugwu
was picked up by the gunmen at his residence at second transformer in Atimbo
while watering flowers in his compound after his abductors shot severally into
the air to scare away residents. A witness,
Mrs. Iquo Etim, said the professor was watering flowers in his compound in the
evening when the gunmen arrived shooting before taking him away. “They took
him through the water. It is like they had been monitoring him for quite a
while because they came in swiftly like they knew the area,” she said. Meanwhile, a
colleague of the kidnapped journalist said that he was picked up on his way
home from an outing in Etta Agbor Layout, Calabar Municipality on Saturday
evening. He said

to their families. “I am aware
of the matter. We are working round the clock to make sure they are
