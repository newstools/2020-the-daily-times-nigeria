He said in a statement that an interdisciplinary One-Health Committee, comprising medical and veterinary specialists, epidemiologists, social scientists, media practitioners, community representatives, should be set up to tackle the scourge. According to him, the committee will advise and assist the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in investigating and managing Lassa fever outbreaks. “Government should provide adequate funds for a sensitive disease surveillance system back by a reliable network of diagnostic laboratories. “Given that only about 20 per cent of suspected Lassa fever cases are usually confirmed, there is need to improve the capability and enhance the capacity of national laboratory network. “This is for reliable and efficient definitive diagnosis of suspected cases. “The Federal and State Governments need to mount an extensive and sustained public Lassa fever prevention and control awareness programme. “Each state should establish a functional isolation ward for the treatment of Lassa fever patients. “It is important to set up a mechanism for improving environmental sanitation in a sustained manner throughout the country to reduce rodent population and rodent to human contact,’’ he said. The expert said that funds should also be provided for research into finding new drugs for the treatment of Lassa fever and the development of vaccine against the scourge.
