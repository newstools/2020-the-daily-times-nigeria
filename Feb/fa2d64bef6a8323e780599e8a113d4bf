This is our commitment to our country. We want to see the security situation improve and that is why we are doing this.“We are dealing with this by trying to institutionalize certain situations that will provide enduring arrangements and solutions to the situation we face today.“So, we will push this to ensure that we pass all these bills and I’m sure Mr. President will assent to these bills because of all the three or four bills taken today, all are security related; none of them is frivolous or simply a bill trying to play to the gallery.
