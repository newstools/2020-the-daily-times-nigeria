Algerian international Hicham Boudaoui on Tuesday was handed a four-match ban following his red card in Nice’s 3-1 defeat by Nimes on February 8. The Professional Football League disciplinary committee handed the hard-tackling midfielder the ban, with three mandatory matches while the fourth match will be suspended.

The former Paradou AC midfielder was equally on the receiving end of a rough tackle by Lyon’s Fernando Macal a few weeks ago. Macal received three-match ban as well. Buadoui’s absence will be a big blow to Patrick Vieira’s men as he has been outstanding in Nice’s midfield putting in a number of man of the match performances. He’s expected back by March 7 just in time for the crucial tie against AS Monaco in the Riviera Derby.
