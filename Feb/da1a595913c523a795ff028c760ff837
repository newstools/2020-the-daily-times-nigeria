Lagos Okada/Keke Ban: Gains, Pains of Brands @AdeBC_ wrote: “New Lagos movement, what do you think!?” New Lagos movement, what do you think!? pic.twitter.com/htymQVOkCv Lagos State government  ban on Okada and Keke  became effective on February 1, 2020, amidst outcry from residents and operators. Despite the outcry that trailed the ban, the state government said there is no going back on the proscription. However, the government introduced new BRT buses to cover some of the areas where Keke were previously operating, still, commuters continue to groan as the buses couldn’t meet the needs of residents in some areas. Well, it seems some residents have decided to devise other means to solve the transport woes that have bedeviled the state in the past few weeks.
