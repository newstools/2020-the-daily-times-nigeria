The Chairman, Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON), Tony Okoroji, on Thursday said that the music of the Late highlife legend, Victor Olaiya,  inspired the old and young. Okoroji, who spoke in Lagos, said Olaiya’s songs cut across age, religion and tribe. Olaiya died at the age of 89 after a brief illness on Wednesday afternoon at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). Okoroji said: “The passage of Victor Abimbola Olaiya is like the falling down of the big Iroko tree for us in the creative industry. “He inspired a lot of people, including the young. His songs cut across tribe, religion and age. “It is the end of an era, because for highlife music, he was one of the big custodians of the art, and he held on to it for almost all of his life.

So we will celebrate him in every way. May his soul rest in perfect peace.” The “Baby Jowo” crooner retired from his musical career in 2017 and had some hit tracks like “Omopupa”; “Jemila”; “So fun mi”; “Tina Meta”; “Pambotoriboto”; “Aigana”; “Odale Ore”; “Mo Fe Muyan”; Opataritius”; “Omolanke”, among others.
