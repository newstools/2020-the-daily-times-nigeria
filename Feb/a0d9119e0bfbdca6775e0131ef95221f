The deputy governor added that the aim of the day was to reduce the incidences of cancer in the community and society, if not totally eradicated. “It can happen to any of us; we should start looking for early diagnosis of the disease. We must always examine ourselves. “Cancer is not a curse; you are not getting cancer because you have sinned. You can get cancer, even if you are the most holy person,” she said. Salako-Oyedele said that Gov. Dapo Abiodun remained passionate about the wellbeing of the people of the state. She added that the governor had put in place aggressive health agenda for the state from primary to tertiary healthcare services toward ensuring that people get the best. In her remarks, the State Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, said that from statistics, one in four adults would end up with the diagnosis of cancer in a life time. Coker emphasised the importance of cancer screening, urging everyone to be examined. According to her, 54 per cent of cancers are caused by breast cancer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer. “This is why in Ogun, we have actually taken time out through the support of Gov. Dapo Abiodun to actually provide free cancer screening. “This campaign is about creating a society that is cancer-free,” the commissioner added.
