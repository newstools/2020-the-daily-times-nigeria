Adoke remains in EFCC custody as he fails to meet bail conditions Adoke is the 1st defendant, Abubakar is the 2nd defendant. The 2nd defendant is being charged on a one-count charge. After the duo pleaded not guilty to the charges, the EFCC counsel, Bala Sanga, urged the court to remand the defendants in the commission’s custody pending the hearing of the matter.
