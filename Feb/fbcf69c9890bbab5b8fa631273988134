Football legend Pele is experiencing “a kind of depression”
and barely leaves home anymore because health problems have left him unable to
walk normally, his son said in an interview published on Monday. “He’s pretty fragile in terms of his mobility and that makes him suffer a kind of depression,” Edinho said of his 79-year-old father, who has had a series of health problems in recent years.

imposing figure, and now he can’t walk normally. He gets very shy, very
embarrassed about that,” his son said in an interview published on the sports news
site Globoesporte.com. Pele, the pride of Brazilian football and the only player to
win three World Cups (1958, 1962 and 1970), is considered by many to be the greatest
footballer of all time. He has been in and out of the hospital in recent years for
various health issues. He never fully recovered from one of his hip operations,
leaving him dependent on a walker, Edinho said. “He’s doing a bit better than when he was in a wheelchair
recently, but he still has a hard time getting around,” said Edinho, 49. Pele’s public appearances have grown increasingly rare with
age. Last April he travelled to Paris for a promotional
appearance with French rising star Kylian Mbappe but had to be hospitalized shortly
after for kidney problems. In 2014, he was placed in intensive care for dialysis after
contracting a severe urinary infection. The Brazilian great, whose real name is Edson Arantes do
Nascimento, has only one kidney, after a broken rib during a match forced
doctors to remove the other. He has also suffered a series of hip problems. Edinho said despite those issues his father is “doing well” physically.
