Despite the inauguration
of the Bayelsa International Airport by the state governor, the Nigerian Civil
Aviation Authority (NCAA) says the airport will not be opened for flight operations
pending the resolutions of all safety issues In an interview with the
general manager, public affairs NCAA, Mr Sam Adurogboye, said the management of
the airport has not met the safety requirements to operate the airport as the
there was no perimeter fence. Adurogboye explained that the airport may have been commissioned by the government but has failed to meet safety standard adding that NCAA inspection team had earlier  visited the airport where some open items were discovered and told them to close the items before coming back for inspection.  But while commissioning
the airport Monday, Governor Sirike Dickson called on the federal government to
direct NCAA to license the airport to commence commercial flight operations. “The airport
can not be used because the Bayelsa government has not complied with the
regulations. Everything we do in the NCAA is based on safety. Once open items
are closed, we will send our people to the airport for inspection”
Adurogboye said. The N60 billion Bayelsa International Airport has been inaugurated twice, the first was on February 15, 2019 where it welcomed its first flight and the last was Monday this week.
