Remi Sonaiya, a former presidential candidate of the KOWA
Party in the 2015 general elections and a professor of French language and
Applied Linguistic at the Obafemi Awolowo University in this interview talks
about the proposed electoral reforms bill, the recent Imo State gubernatorial
election judgement by the Supreme Court among other issues. PATRICK OKOHUE reports ************The process of amendment of the 2010 Electoral Act has begun; do you support the agitations for delisting of non performing smaller political parties? FG commends Obaseki as over 5,000 Edo residents get jobs, micro credit Agreed, there is no doubt, having like seventy or more
political parties on the ballot is wasteful, its expensive; it is confusing for
a lot of people. But I don’t think they can impose PDP or APC on us because
many of us believe that they are the same party. They are just a group of
people who are just mismanaging the country and taking advantage of the
resources of the country to win elections. They take money from the government
and they are using that money to win elections; those that give them any moral
authority than the rest of us? So they keep saying that the smaller parties are not making
impact, but you are using the money of the country to buy votes, you give
people N5, 000, N10, 000 or more and because they know that Nigerians are poor
they deliberately keep the people poor so that they can buy their votes. Now they are saying that the smaller parties are not
performing, if we had a level playing ground, if they are not using the state
funds, if they are not being paid very huge salaries, if all of us compete in a
level-playing-field, do you think all of us would not make an inroad. So I don’t agree at all, they don’t have the moral right to
say the smaller parties are just crowding the field. Yes we need to sit down
and talk about the system, but the thing is they are being elected through
corruption; they are not being elected in a fair manner that is the reality. **********Part of the agitations is for electronic voting,
do you agree it’s time for it? In fact without having electronic voting, digital voting or
anything close to that is all part and why there can be rigging and so on.  The system can be compromised. Let a group of
independent innovative thinkers look at the situation in Nigeria. Nigeria is
said to be one of the most innovative countries in the world with the highest
number of mobile phones, can we not use that to our advantage in voting? But
they want to keep us to their advantage. What they want is to continue using a system that would
ensure rigging and I think it is time to say no to all of that. *********What is your take on the recent Imo State gubernatorial
election Supreme Court judgement? I don’t understand it. I reacted like many Nigerians did
because I don’t understand how somebody got all the votes which were not
counted earlier. So when they counted and added his votes, it happened that all
the people in the constituency voted only for this man. It is surprising is it
not? And this is a party that has no single vote in the state House of Assembly
election, but they voted for him in the governorship election, are they making
us fools or what? Now somebody who was third in the primaries was now given
the governorship election, we have to query the Supreme Court on that
Judgement. ************What is your take on the security situation in
the country, there is the popular view that President Muhammadu Buhari is not
doing enough. Do you agree? Obviously he is not doing enough. Look at the way IPOB was
dealt with and IPOB did not kill anybody, they did not burn down villages but
they unleash operation python, how come that kind of resolve have not been
shown in the dealing with other security challenges? I mean the herdsmen, the
Boko Haram terrorising our people. So for me those are the questions that people are asking;
how can we say the most have been done when you unleash the strength of the
security forces to tackle the situation in some areas and not in some areas? ************Do you support agitations for zoning of the
presidency to the South in 2023? I don’t believe in it at all, we need competent people to
run our affairs, but by the way I am one of the people who are hoping that we
would not have to run election again under the current system, because it is
clear that the current system is not working. For me, I think we need a change; I am one of the people
calling for restructuring of the country. What I mean is a return to federal state,
where the central would not be so powerful to control the resources of the
country. ***********Is that possible, even the North and President
Buhari do not believe in it? I don’t know, but that is what I want. It is my opinion and
that is what I want to see take place. I believe in competence and merit. I am
not for zoning that cannot lead us anywhere, I don’t believe in it.
