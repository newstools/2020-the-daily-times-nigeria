The Edo State government on Wednesday, alleged that
explosions that rocked the homes of some All Progressives Congress (APC)
chieftains in the state is a plot to get President Muhammadu Buhari to declare
a state of emergency. The government alleged that the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM)
carried out the explosions in order to create a sense of insecurity in Edo
state. The State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr.
Paul Ohonbamu, speaking to reporters explained that the group’s failed attempt
to get the House of Assembly to remove Governor Godwin Obaseki resorted to
using explosives. It will be recalled that the factional state secretary of
the APC in Edo State, Lawrence Okah, escaped death when a bomb explosion rocked
his residence on Tuesday, February 11. In a related development, the crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of the APC will end after the party’s nominations ahead of the state’s 2020 governorship election, a factional chairman of the party, David Imuse has said. Imuse noted that the crisis would not lead to parallel
primaries between the two factions as many have feared. Child abuse: FCTA embarks on name and shame It would be recalled
that the crises in Edo has taken another dimension as the state government is
seeking arrest and prosecution of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. The state wants the
national chairman of the APC arrested and prosecuted by the security agencies
for disobeying the orders of the state government.
