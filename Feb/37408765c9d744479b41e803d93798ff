pre-retirement so that when they retire you have something to lay your hands
upon. Last year, we trained about 160 for the paucity of funds, we have to be doing

were having about 300 and something people, today NAMA is over 600, FAAN from
little over 1,000 but today, we are close to 2,000, the society is doing well.”
