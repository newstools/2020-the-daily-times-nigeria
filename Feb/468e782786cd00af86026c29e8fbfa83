raise the average tariffs from the current level of 27.30 N/kWh to 40.95 N/kWh. The DisCo said,

tariff model contained in the document, Ikeja DisCo Tariff Model Jan 2020. “In this
application, we intend to create a new tariff class, called Bilateral; a class
that is being created for customers that IE has a signed Power Purchase
Agreement (PPA) with under a willing-buyer-willing seller arrangement. In order to
provide an efficient and reliable service to customers in this tariff class,
cost-reflective tariffs are required to cover the cost of service delivery. They said, there
total bilateral energy procured is currently 200MW, however, bilateral sales in
the application is only the portion of the bilateral energy that has been
contracted with customers on a willing-buyer-willing seller arrangement. The power firm
said, that the expected MYTO 2020 and bilateral revenue requirement are
collected sales (GWh) in MYTO is 3,955mw, and bilateral 161mw, total 2020 for
4,116mw. According to IE,
the collected energy sales based on the 50 per cent tariff increase in MYTO is
3,955GWh, while of the bilateral sales is 161GWh. It also noted
that the expected MYTO 2020 and bilateral revenue requirement, are N162billion
and N8billion respectively, to give a total revenue requirement of N170billion. The IE said that
the “50 per cent tariff increase is expected to raise the average tariffs from
the current level of 27.30 N/kWh to 40.95 N/kWh.” The document
added that “the addition of bilateral sales revenue requirement further
increases the average tariffs to 41.31N/kWh. Over the next five years
(2020-2024), we have assumed the bilateral revenue requirement forms part of
the title allowed revenue,” they said.
