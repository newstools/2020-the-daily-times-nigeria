The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Osogbo field office said it has sealed 29 Liquefied Petroleum Gas facilities for allegedly operating without valid licences in the state. DPR’s Head of Operations, Olusegun Daboh, said this in an interview on Sunday in Osogbo. He said the illegal gas stations were sealed in Ile-Ife, Ikire, Ejigbo, Iwo, Ila-Orangun, Ede, Gbongan and Ode-Omu Township. The department had in the last few weeks sealed more than 25 gas plants operating without valid licences in the state. Daboh however, said the department during its routine surveillance discovered that many gas stations were operating without genuine licences and within residential areas. The DPR official, who noted that proliferation of illegal gas stations in the state has reached a worrisome level, said the agency would continue to clamp down on all the illegal gas plants in the state. “Most of this gas plants not only illegal, did not meet safety guidelines on the establishment of gas plants. “As an agency mandated with responsibility of ensuring safety in oil and gas industry, we cannot fold our arms watching people operating illegally. “As a matter of fact, we are giving all illegal gas skid operators in the state till of February to close shop, while those with expired licences should come for renewal.

The head of operations also said that the agency would not rest until all the illegal gas plants in the state were shut, adding that the safety of the gas users was paramount to the department.
