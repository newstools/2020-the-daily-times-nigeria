He said that the alleged offences contravened Sections 168 and 411 of the Criminal laws of Lagos State 2015. The Chief Magistrate, Mr A. A. Fashola, granted each of the defendants N50, 000 bail with two sureties in like sum. Fashola ordered that the sureties must be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. He  added that such sureties must reside within the court’s jurisdiction, and adjourned the case until  Feb.27, for mention. The conspiracy is punishable with two years’ imprisonment while breach of the peace attracts six months’ jail term or  N50, 000 fine.
