The Edo State Government has said that the suspended National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and his co-dissidents in the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM) are planning to sponsor protests across the state targeted at maligning and undermining the government. In a statement, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said the motive behind the plan is to “incite the public and cause disaffection in the state in order to slow down the rapid pace of development, which has won the state government the hearts of the majority of Edo people in the last three years.” According to him, “Having failed in his inordinate ambition to impose himself as the godfather who makes all decisions and losing grip of the APC structure in the state, Comrade Oshiomhole and his allies have resorted to a final option of stage-managing protests and violent attacks, with the intention to cause crisis and disaffection among the people.
