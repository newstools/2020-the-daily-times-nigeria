Ari said that the best way to celebrate valentine was to show love to the needy and the vulnerable in the society. “However, some people have a different perspective to this, they prefer to show love to the orphanage, the windows and most vulnerable in the society. “This, for me, is the most sensible and appealing way to celebrate valentine,” she said.
