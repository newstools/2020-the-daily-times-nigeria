The Federal High Court in Abuja with presiding Judge. Justice Okon Abang  is presently delivering judgement in a suit instituted against a former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Olisa Metuh by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The anti-graft agency accused the former PDP spokesman of money laundering to the tune of N400,000,000. Reports said that, he was charged alongside his company, Destra investment, with seven counts bordering on criminal diversion of the money received from the office of the former National Security Adviser, Colonel Sambo Dasuki (rtd).
