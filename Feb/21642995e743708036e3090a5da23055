Emmanuel Silas, had urged the court to remand the defendant for 30 days at first instance, pending advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Silas alleged that the defendant committed the offence on Feb. 3, about 10:30 a.m., at Lady-Lak, Bariga. He also alleged that the defendant had beaten his wife Esther, to death on the said day after an argument ensued between them. The offence, however, contravened Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, which prescribes a death sentence for convict. The Chief Magistrate, Mr O.O. Olatunji ordered the remand of the defendant at the Ikoyi Custodial Centre pending receipt of advice. Olatunji, however, adjourned the case until March 17.
