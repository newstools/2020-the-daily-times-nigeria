Transport Minister Ali Hammoud told accompanying newsmen aboard the plane that the airport’s reopening was a “big victory.” According to the Syrian Transport Ministry, flights to Cairo and Damascus are planned in the coming days. In 2017, the ministry announced the resumption of operations at Aleppo’s airport, however those were called off after the facility was shelled by rebels fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. According to official estimates, Aleppo airport, Syria’s second-largest after Damascus International Airport, has a capacity of 1.7 million passengers annually. A Syrian government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Syrian, Iranian and Russian carriers would be the primary users of Aleppo’s airport for now. (dpa/NAN)
