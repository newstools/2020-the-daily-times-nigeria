Following threat to peace across many parts of Edo State following
sharp disagreements among leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and
other political parties in the state, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Lawan
Tanko Jimeta has cautioned politicians in the state to desist from any act
capable of inciting violence and political crisis as the September governorship
election of the state draws closer. CP Jimeta said no crisis whether political or not is healthy
for any nation or state that wishes to grow both economically and in terms of
infrastructure. The state police boss said this when addressing newsmen at a
stakeholders’ meeting with sister security agencies, non-governmental organisations
and members of political party present in Benin City the state capital. According to him, “We as security personnel will make sure
this ugly incident does not repeat itself, because it will scare away
development in the state. “No more room for thuggery and lawlessness. The use of explosive is becoming worrisome. Political crisis does not guarantee political success. We are talking to you people as stakeholders so that you can talk to your people,” he said. JEDC proposes 10.5% electricity tariff increase He stressed that security operatives will be all out for

of a better Edo State in all their doings. Other agencies present at the stakeholders meeting where the
