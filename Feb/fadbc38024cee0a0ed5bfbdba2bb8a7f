And the drug sellers may be selling Tramadol and all these hard drugs to them,” he said. Okapo said that the communities were acting in ignorance and needed  all stakeholders to sensitise them to understand the implications of this attitude. He said that drug abuse led to increase in crime, adding that individuals in the communities should volunteer information that would help in reducing drug abuse menace in the state. Okapo said that youths addicted to drugs contributed to the high number of out-of-school drop outs as most of them depend on drugs to function daily. He said the command would deal with any person involved in hard drugs, adding that in 2019 the command removed about 845,034 kilograms of hard drugs from circulation in the state.
