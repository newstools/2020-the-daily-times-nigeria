Maria Sharapova is retiring from professional tennis at the
age of 32 after five Grand Slam titles and time ranked No. 1. She has been dealing with shoulder problems for years.

decision to walk away from the sport, posted online Wednesday, Sharapova asks:
“How do you leave behind the only life you’ve ever known?” She burst onto the tennis scene at 17 when she won Wimbledon
in 2004 and would go on to complete a career Grand Slam with two titles at the
French Open and one each at the U.S. Open and Australian Open. The Russian, who moved to Florida as a child, served a
15-month ban after failing a doping test in 2016. Since that suspension, Sharapova managed to reach only one
major quarterfinal. After so much success on the tennis court and off, so much
time in the spotlight, Sharapova walks away having lost four consecutive matches
at Grand Slam tournaments. The latest came last month at the Australian Open, where she
was beaten 6-3, 6-4 by Donna Vekic. That sent her ranking tumbling outside of
the top 350 – she is 373rd this week – and Sharapova has not played anywhere
since. She was asked after that defeat whether it might have been
her last appearance at Melbourne Park, where she won the trophy in 2008, and
she repeatedly replied with “I don’t know.” But her right shoulder has been a problem off-and-on for more
than a decade. She played a total of 15 matches last season, going 8-7. “I put in all the right work. There is no guarantee
that even when you do all of those things, that you’re guaranteed victory in a
first round or in the third round or in the final. That’s the name of this
game,” Sharapova said after what turned out to be her final match.
“That’s why it’s so special to be a champion, even for one time.”
