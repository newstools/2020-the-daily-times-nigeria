The Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has recorded 94 per cent hike in the
cases of wilful hacking and destruction of its pipelines across the country in November
2019. This is even as the Corporation said that the daily average natural gas supply to gas-powered plants in the same month increased by 16.53 per cent to 645 mmscfd. Borno reopens Maiduguri-Dikwa road, 5 years after closure According to the 53rd edition of the NNPC Monthly Financial
and Operations Report (MFOR), oil thieves are culprits in the destruction of its pipelines. In fact, a total of 68 pipeline points were vandalised,
representing about 94 per cent increase from the 35 points that were breached
in October 2019. The report added that out of the vandalised points, 15 failed
to be welded while only two pipeline points were ruptured. A breakdown of the breach indicated that the Mosimi-Ibadan
axis accounted for 31 per cent of the breaks; Atlas Cove-Mosimi network
witnessed 19 per cent, while Ibadan-Ilorin and other routes accounted for 15
per cent and 35 per cent respectively. The MFOR noted that NNPC, in collaboration with the local
communities and other stakeholders would continuously strive to reduce and
eventually, eliminate this menace through effective collaboration. The report also disclosed that the daily average natural gas
supply to gas-powered plants in November last year increased by 16.53 per cent
to 645mmscfd, equivalent to power generation of 2,178MW. Comparatively, the October 2019 gas supply to power averaged
553mmscfd to generate 2,050 MW, a release yesterday in Abuja by NNPC Acting
Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr Samson Makoji, has
said. National gas production in November 2019 stood at 228.65
billion cubic feet (BCF), translating to an average daily production of
7,621.68 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd). From November 2018 to November 2019, a total of 3,091.24 BCF
of gas was produced, representing an average daily production of 7,882.27mmscfd
during the period, according to the report. A period-to-date Production from Joint Ventures (JVs),
Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) and the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company
(NPDC) contributed about 69.5 per cent, 21.06 per cent and 9.44 per cent
respectively to the total national gas production. Out of the total volume of gas supplied in November 2019,
137.02BCF of gas was commercialized, consisting of 35.29BCF and 101.73BCF for
the domestic and export market respectively. This translates to a total supply of 1,176.40mmscfd of gas to
the domestic market and 3,391.04mmscfd of gas supplied to the export market for
the month, implying that 59.91 per cent of the average daily gas produced was
commercialized, while the balance of 40.09 per cent was re-injected, used as
upstream fuel gas or flared.

Gas flare rate was 8.29 per cent for the month under review,
i.e. 632.37mmscfd, compared with an average gas flare rate of 8.80 per cent,
i.e. 692.97mmscfd for the period November 2018 to November 2019.
