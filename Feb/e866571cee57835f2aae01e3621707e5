priority to Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs) in agriculture,
construction and automotive industries by providing tax incentives for them.

Minister of Industry, Trade and
Investment, Niyi Adebayo, who made this disclosure stated that the ministry had started work on
delivering tax and regulatory incentives for SME.Adebayo noted that the government was
modernising bilateral investment agreements which are facilitated through the Nigerian Investment Promotion
Commission (NIPC), adding that the federal government aimed to enhance the
ease of doing business and support the growth of SMEs. This, he said, would attract global investors when viewed against the backdrop of the country’s capacity for growth. “The Federal Government seeks to localize at least 40 per cent of its expenditure on stipulated goods and services to facilitate local markets access for Nigeria-made products.

mobilising capital, incentivising priority sectors and expanding market access
for local producers,” Adebayo said. It would be recalled that the federal government
