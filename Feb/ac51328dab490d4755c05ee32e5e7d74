A Kaduna State High Court on Monday has resumed the trial of
the embattled leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Ibrahim El-
Zakzaky, and his wife, Zeenat. Reports said, El-Zakzaky and his wife are facing eight counts over allegations of culpable homicide, unlawful assembly, disruption of public peace, and criminal conspiracy among others.

government. Both defendants were brought to the court to take their
plea, amid heavy security presence. Their arraignment today comes about three weeks after the
last hearing of the suit against them on February 6, after the case was
adjourned for eight months. The trial judge, Justice Gideon Kurada, had amended the
charges against the defendants from four people to two and excluded two other
accused persons who are still at large, to enable the trial of the IMN leader
and his wife commence without delay. The judge also ordered that the defendants should be allowed
to be seen by their private doctors at the Nigerian Correctional Service
facility in the Kaduna State capital, with close supervision of the facility
management. He, however, adjourned the case until February 24 and 25 for
accelerated hearing. Ahead of the coupleâ€™s arrival in court, security was being
beefed up in the Kaduna metropolis in what seems to have become a tradition. Security operatives cordoned off all major roads leading to
the court complex and the court premises, in order to avert any breakdown of
law and order, as a result of the violent protests by members of the Shiite
group in Abuja and some other cities in the North. The IMN leader and his wife have been in detention since their arrest in December 2015 following a bloody clash between the Shiites and soldiers in Zaria, Kaduna State.(  Channels TV)
