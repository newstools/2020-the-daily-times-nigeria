Manchester City’s appeal against their two-year European ban
has been officially registered by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, CAS
announced on Wednesday. The Premier League club who were fined 30m euros (£25m) for “serious breaches” of Uefa’s financial regulations have vowed to fight the sanction. READ ALSO:  Breaking: Maria Sharapoava announces retirement Although CAS did not indicate a time-frame for the appeal
process, it is expected to take several months. In a statement, CAS said: “The Court of Arbitration for
Sport (CAS) has registered an appeal filed by Manchester City football club
against the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA).” City face losing hundreds of millions of pounds in prize
money, TV revenue, gate receipts and sponsorship income should their appeal
against the ban fail. Last week City Football Group CEO Ferran Soriano said the
club hoped to have their appeal heard by CAS before the start of next season’s
Champions League. He said UEFA’s charges against the club of overstating their
sponsorship revenue between 2012 and 2016 and failing to cooperate with an
investigation were “simply not true.”
