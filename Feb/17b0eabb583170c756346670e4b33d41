President Muhammadu Buhari has reiterated the commitment of his administration to ensure the release of all children and captives of terrorists across the country and beyond. The president gave
the assurance in a message he personally signed in Abuja on Tuesday. Buhari’s message
was released by the media unit of the State House, Abuja, to mark the second
anniversary of the abduction of the 107 Dapchi school girls in Yobe. “Two years ago, 110
innocent children from the town of Dapchi were taken, against their will, by
terrorists of Boko Haram, 107 survived the ordeal. Today all but one – Leah
Sharibu – are returned to their families. “Now aged 16, Leah
remains in the hands of the terrorists – they say because she refuses to
renounce her Christian faith. “We say, as the government for and of all Nigerians, that no person has the right to force another to change their faith against their will and that all life is sacred. FG seeks US support in tacking poverty, child labour “This government
continues and seeks to secure the release of all children and captives of
terrorists – and we do so regardless of their creed or the name of their
creator. “As we redouble our
efforts for Leah’s return, we can never allow the terrorists to divide us –
Christian against Muslim, Muslim against Christian. We are all Sons of Abraham. “And all Nigerians
have the same worth and rights before the law, and before God,” he said.
