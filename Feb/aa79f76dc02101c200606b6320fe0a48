The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ilorin zonal office has arrested a 38-year-old man, Festus Abiona, who was indicted by the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) over his alleged involvement in internet fraud. Abiona has been on the wanted list of the commission for more than eight months over the alleged fraud case before luck ran out on him and he was finally arrested in his hide-out. APGA chieftain writes Buhari demands arrest of ex-Gov Yari Operatives of the EFCC smoked
him out of his hiding on February 6, from his beautifully built duplex in
Arepo,Ogun state. He had
gone into hiding and deliberately refused to step out of his house, when he got
wind of the fact that the EFCC was investigating him. For the past five months,
he was in hiding for fear of being arrested. In the FBI petition
dated July 10, 2019, it was alleged that he was involved
in business e-mail compromise and other internet-related fraud. The petition stated further:
“In May 2016, the FBI received information that an actor or actors by-passed
online security to steal money from retirement accounts held by an insurance
company for public workers in the United States, which resulted in the
loss of approximately $2,500, 000. “The accounts contained
numerous communications between Abiona and other criminal co-conspirators
seeking to commit business e-mail compromise, tax refund fraud and other computer
enabled fraud.” Investigation into the case by
the commission revealed that a syndicate that involved Abiona perpetrated
the fraud. Millions of naira were traced to his bank accounts
and some of the e-mails used in perpetrating the fraud have been taken over
from the suspect. The suspect on sighting
operatives of the EFCC flushed all his SIM cards into the toilet and
destroyed all his automated teller machines cards in order to destroy evidence. He has also
refused to give a statement since his arrest and will soon be arraigned
in court.
