The prosecutor told the court that during police investigation, one Rabiu Mohammed of Rikkos was arrested. The prosecutor said that the defendant admitted committing the crime and that the stolen phone was eventually recovered. He said that Mohammed’s two accomplices, Ibrahim Pus and Yaya Mole were still at large. Longwal said that the offence contravened Sections 377 and 275 of the Plateau State Penal Code of Northern Nigeria.
