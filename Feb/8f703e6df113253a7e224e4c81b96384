Dr Vincent Okpala, state Commissioner for Health who made the disclosure in an interview in Awka, said it would improve healthcare delivery in the state.

And the drone technology can make many trips a day, “he said. Okpala said acquiring one of the drones would cover all the hard-to-reach communities in the state. According to him, it will be the first in Nigeria. (NAN)
