The police on Tuesday arraigned 12 men before a Yaba Magistrates’ Court in Lagos, over their alleged membership of secret cults and breach of peace. The accused are Olafuyi Toheeb (20), Salami Idris (26), Mubarak Raheem (22), Orioye Akinmoleya (27), Saliu Sunday (24), Adewunmi Yakub (30) and Razaq Rilwan (33). Others include Ajao Abiodun (21), Taiwo Adebowale (25), Segun Abiodun (20), Adegbesan Olawale (25) and Albert Oluwaseun (30). They are facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, breach of peace and membership of an unlawful society. The accused persons however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Police prosecutor, Godwin Oriabure, told the court that the 12 accused persons committed the offences at about 6 pm on January 26, at Total Benson area, Ikorodu, Lagos. He alleged that the accused who were members of `Aiye’, a cult group had clashed with a rival cult group, causing the death of one Elijah Ayodele. Oriabure further said that Ayodele’s corpse was left on the floor for several hours along the street after the clash, adding that eyewitness accounts revealed the identities of the culprits to the police during investigation. “Investigation is still ongoing on the matter, especially the death of Ayodele,” he said. According to him, the offences contravene Sections 41, 168 (d) and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos state, 2015. Section 41 prescribes three years imprisonment if found guilty of membership of an outlawed society while Section 411 provides for two-year jail term for conspiracy.
