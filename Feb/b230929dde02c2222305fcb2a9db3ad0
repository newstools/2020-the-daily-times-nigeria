An aspirant for the vacant position of the deputy national
chairman (South) of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Hon. Michael Akinleye
has sued the national chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole over an
alleged plot to impose former Oyo State governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi for
the role. The former occupant of the position, Otunba Niyi Adebayo,
himself a former governor of Ekiti State, was appointed the minister of trade
and industry in 2019 by President Muhammadu Buhari. The news made the rounds earlier this year that Senator
Ajimobi is set to replace Otuba Adebayo in the position. An aggrieved Akinleye has, however, filed the case before a
Federal High court in Ado-Ekiti, through his counsel, Taiwo Omidoyin and Tunde
Oke. The plaintiff in an originating summon said his right had been violated and grossly infringed upon by the action taken by Oshiomhole. Winning the battle against Sickle Cell Anaemia He noted that he expressed his interest to vie for the
position in a letter dated Monday, January 20, which he forwarded to Ekiti State
chapter of the APC to nominate him for the position. Akinleye is the current chairman of APC in Ado Ekiti Local
Government Area of Ekiti State. Senator Gbenga Aluko, also from Ekiti, was
contesting for the vacant position and was the preferred candidate from Ekiti
APC caucus. The plaintiff asked the court to restrain the party from
nominating Senator Ajimobi or anybody to the vacant position without following
the due process and dictate of the APC constitution. The case has been scheduled for Thursday, March 12 for
definite hearing, after all the parties have been duly served.
