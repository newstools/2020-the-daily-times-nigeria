His wife was also killed in the airstrike, which was carried out near the town of Saakow by Africom in coordination with the Somali government. She was a “witting and active member of al-Shabaab responsible for facilitating a wide range of terrorist activities,” according to Africom. “This strike demonstrates that we will continue to relentlessly pursue those responsible for Manda Bay and those wishing to do harm to Americans and our African partners,” said Africom’s commander, Gen. Stephen Townsend. “Al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda affiliate, is an evil and remorseless enemy of peace, stability, and freedom in East Africa and threatens the very way of life of people there, as well as Americans and U.S. interest in the region and abroad,” he added. The terrorist militia, which wants to establish an Islamist state in Somalia, repeatedly attacks security forces and civilians. It is based in Somalia, but also regularly carries out attacks in neighbouring Kenya. (dpa/NAN)FAT/RSA
