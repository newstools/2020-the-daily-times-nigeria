The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said
banks are no longer allowed to sack more than five staff without its approval. This was part of the communiqué released by
the Bankers Committee after its meeting on Friday. The committee, in a circular signed by Director, Financial Markets Department, CBN, Angela Sere-Ejembi, emphasized that all banks should send a sample of Contract Letter issued to outsourced staff + SLA  with the company being used to run outsourced staff.

by the CBN circular in respect of laying off staff that is more than five. This
requires apex bank’s notification and approval going forward.” The Bankers’ Committee had said the mass
sacking in banks would be reduced in the shortest time possible. The committee noted that while it was
working on how to reduce the level of job losses in the sector, there would
always be reasons people would have to be sacked from their workplaces. It explained that while the decision to sack
bank workers had elicited a lot of sentiments from both the public and private
sectors of the economy, the banks understood the implications of having to
relieve workers of their jobs in view of the current economic situation in the
country.
