He said his team retrieved the bodies of five people and rescued the survivors from the lake, which is the countryâ€™s largest artificial body of water. It was created in the early 1960s when a dam was built over the Karnaphuli River for a hydro-electricity project. Nath could not determine the reason for the accident. Police officer Khan Nurul-Islam said the victims came from neighbouring Chattogram district for a weekend visit. Those who died in the accident were employees of a garment factory in Chattogram, he added. Boat capsize deaths are frequent in Bangladesh, which is full of rivers. Experts blame poor safety measures and the lax implementation of regulations.
