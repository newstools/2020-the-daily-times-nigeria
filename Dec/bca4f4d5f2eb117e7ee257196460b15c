Suspected hoodlums have invaded the office of the Speaker of Ogun State House of Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, and carted away the assembly’s mace, Daily Times gathered. The incident happened on Thursday, when the yet-to-be-identified hoodlums broke into the speaker’s office overnight and stole the official symbol of the legislature. When our PUNCH correspondent visited the assembly building which is located a few metres away from the Governor’s Office complex in the precinct of the State Secretariat, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, some security agents denied access into the complex, citing orders from above.

The PPRO added that an investigation into the burglary and theft has commenced. Oyeyemi said, “Yes, there is an unfortunate incident today in the assembly complex.
