It tasked the president to see the Bishop’s message as a wake-up call with a view to adjusting his policies and programmes for the betterment of the Nigeria and Nigerians. Taking a swipe at those attacking the catholic Bishop, the Nigerian Muslim Professionals said that those condemning him were  doing it for their pecuniary gains and not the interest of the country. It warned against twisting the message to mean the Bishop endorses coup,saying contrary to those promoting that insinuation, the revered Bishop was too learned to support such ignoble path to installing leadership,saying Nigerians with conscience would not fall to the antics of those twisting the Bishop’s message for selfish reasons. The group said having followed Bishop Kukah’s activities and preachings since the days of the military, it was convinced that not to many Nigerians took the interest of the country at heart like kukah”. “Even during the military era where people dreaded the powers that  be at the time, Bishop Kukah,who was then a Catholic priest spoke truth to those at the helm of affairs without fear or favour. He has shown through his actions all the years that he is a true son of Nigeria in particular and Africa in general. We should support him for being bold enough to come out to speak what many Nigerians know is the truth but afraid to speak out for fear of the leadership”, the statement read. ” While we must admit that President Muhammad Buhari means well for the nation, we  must say that most people  in his government are grossly incompetent and don’t deserve to stay around power even in an uncivilized space,” the group stated. The group said it would not shy away from the truth even though most of the president’s actions drawing criticisms were in favour of its region. It flayed the glaring marginalisation of the Igbo in every facet of national life,saying the development was not promoting national cohesion which nationalists that laid down their lives for the country’s independence wanted. “There’s nothing wrong with Bishop kukah’s statement in the actual sense. Some regions particularly the South East  has been marginalized in successive governments, and the administration of President Muhammad Buhari came and amplified it with the worst,”it added. Daily Times recalls that the Archbishop Bishop of Sokoto Catholic diocese  was  quoted as accusing President Muhammadu Buhari of piloting Nigeria into darkness in the message titled:”A Nation in Search of Vindication.” He took swipe at the worsening state of insecurity in the country just as he berated the current federal administration of glaringly abandoning the nation’s extant federal character principles and rather promoting nepotism with impunity. The development has been drawing criticisms from the president’s friends,political associates and party, the ruling All Progressives Congress,APC.
