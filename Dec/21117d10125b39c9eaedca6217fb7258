National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP),  Uche Secondus, has urged President  Muhammadu to face governance and stop moving about “begging” opposition figures to join the All Progressives Congress. Secondus said this at an ongoing media interface in Abuja, on Thursday, December 10. He explained that Nigeria’s current socio-economic challenges, as well as growing insecurity, will have been a thing of the past if the President and the ruling party had focused on delivering on their campaign promises to Nigerians.
