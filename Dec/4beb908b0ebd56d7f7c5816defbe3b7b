The National Assembly and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have commenced the process of Electoral Act amendment, ahead of the 2023 general election, Daily Times gathered. The joint Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the House Committee on Electoral Matters are currently holding a one-day public hearing. The public hearing which is well attended by the joint Committee members and Civil Society Groups will holistically look at the 2010 Electoral Act with a view to amending it. Sources from Civil Society Groups indicate they would be demanding that candidates must be graduates to qualify and that INEC must handle the processes of elections more transparently than it is at the moment. Recall that the Electoral Act was similarly amended by the 8th Senate which was not assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari for undisclosed reasons before the end of that session.
