I do not watch movies; I never watch movies. I met her the first time when she came to my house with her mother and her siblings because my place in Delta is a tourist place. They came to look around and I liked her and that was it. “So whether I marry another wife or not; she knows it can happen. I come from a very polygamous environment.
