We must defend Biafra land no matter the price. “Biafra Security Network personnel will release special phone numbers for people to call whenever there is any case of criminality including kidnapping and robbery activities in the whole of Biafraland. “Every resident in Biafraland should use the numbers to report any criminal activity anywhere in Biafraland for a prompt response. “Fulani herdsmen attack on our mothers and sisters must stop in our land with immediate effect. Unnecessary police brutality on innocent citizens also must stop. “Police and Army checkpoints which have since been converted to extortion points should be dismantled. “Any attempt to sabotage this Security Network will be stoutly resisted. IPOB is a peaceful movement but ready to defend our land and people no matter the cost. “We want to make it clear that Eastern Security Network is not a Biafran Army but simply a vigilante group like Amotekun in the West.
