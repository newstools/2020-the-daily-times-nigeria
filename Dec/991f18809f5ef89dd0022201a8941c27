Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has said he is in opposition with zoning, Daily Times gathered. Fayemi made this statement while speaking on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics yesterday while reacting to the call for Nigeria to have a president from the Southern part of the country in 2023. Fayemi said he understands why those who feel marginalized are clamoring for the presidency, but insisted that “in a country that is multicultural, multireligious and multiethnic, one of the equilibrating mechanisms is to ensure that those in leadership represent the mosaic that the country is”. According to him, “there are excellent Nigerians from all parts of the country”. Fayemi who was in charge of the APC primaries in 2014, noted that candidates from any part of the country can participate in the primaries ahead of the next general election.
