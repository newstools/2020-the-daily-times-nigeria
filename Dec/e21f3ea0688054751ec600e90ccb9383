Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has expressed displeasure over Thomas Partey’s decision to walk off the pitch after sustaining an injury during their 2-0 defeat at Tottenham on Sunday, Daily Times gathered. Partey had just returned from a thigh injury to start the North London Derby. The Ghana international walked over to the touchline during the build-up to Harry Kane’s goal that put Spurs 2-0 up and was replaced by Dani Ceballos immediately. After the match, Arteta confirmed Party would have an MRI, but insisted the 27-year-old was supposed to stay on the pitch during the attack. “I applaud their first goal, it is world class, but the second goal we were a man down, we left a massive gap and they took advantage,” Arteta told the BBC. “He [Thomas Partey] has to stay on the pitch. It looks like the same injury he has already had, he will have an MRI.” READ ALSO: Fresh #EndSARS protest dangerous, premature, Yahaya Bello warns
