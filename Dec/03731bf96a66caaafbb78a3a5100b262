These shall ideally be innovative value-added products that are establishing footprint in the Nigerian market, and require additional funds to increase output,” the Director General said. He therefore called for applications from all suitably-qualified MSEs located in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Kaduna and Oyo states to apply for the programme. Dr.Radda also stated that prospective beneficiaries who must be registered with SMEDAN may apply for loans within the range of N1.2 million to N5 million on business–friendly terms including waiver of collaterals.
