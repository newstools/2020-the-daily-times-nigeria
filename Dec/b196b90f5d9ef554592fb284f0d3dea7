A former National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole has absolved himself from a fresh lawsuit challenging the dissolution of the National Working Committee he formerly presided over, Daily Times gathered. The suit was filed by the former National Vice Chairman (South South), Hilliard Eta. Oshiomhole cleared the air on his association with the suit in a statement titled, ‘My Position Has Not Changed,’ which he signed, on Monday. Oshiomhole, said, he was not the one who filed the court documents. The statement read in part, “In reporting the legal action taken by a member of the dissolved National Working Committee of the APC, some attributions have been made to the effect that the plaintiff is an ‘ally of Oshiomhole’ or an “associate of Oshiomhole.” The court documents are clear on who is the plaintiff. “For the avoidance of doubt, the 21-member NWC under my leadership largely worked cohesively and harmoniously. The only exceptions were those of the three members used by forces desperate to take control of the party. “The majority of 18 members worked as a team and not as allies or loyalists of anybody. When the National Executive Committee in its wisdom dissolved the NWC, I immediately announced publicly that I accepted the decision, regardless of its illegality or otherwise, as it affected my position as national chairman.” The former APC chairman said it would be mischievous of him to contest the matter in court after publicly denouncing the same. Oshiomhole also said, “That chapter of my political life is closed. Even if another NEC decision or a court order reverses the dissolution, with utmost humility I will decline to return as APC chairman.” READ ALSO: EndSARS: Nigerians react as police, LASTMA officers storm Lekki toll gate
