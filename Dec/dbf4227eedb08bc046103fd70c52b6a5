Nigerian singer Simi got her fans and followers in frenzy after the singer dropped a steamy video to her Instagram page. Daily Times reports that the video showed the beautiful mother of one in bed with a young Caucasian guy. She was draped in a satin short gown; her face was made up and paired it with a black fringe-bob hairdo. The Caucasian guy, however, was dressed in print trousers and a shirt which was unbuttoned to show his white inner-wear. With their hands locked together, both were spotted looking into each otherâ€™s eyes as Simi made some inaudible sounds.
