Former governor of Anambra and former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), presidential running mate, Peter Obi, has said the defection of the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi to the All Progressives Congress (APC) has no economic impact on Nigerians, Daily Times gathered. Obi made this statement while speaking on Arise Television yesterday, wondering how many lives Umahi had impacted upon economically, amid his defection. He, therefore, called on Nigerians not to be distracted by Umahi’s defection. According to Obi: “How many people have been pulled out of poverty by Umahi’s defection? Will Nigeria exit recession because Umahi left PDP? “What economic value does Umahi’s defection to APC have on the average Nigerian on the street who is struggling to put food on their table? “We must not be distracted by political movements at this time. Anyone is free to belong to any political party. Our common focus should be saving our economy and making our governance fruitful and productive.” Umahi had recently defected from PDP to the APC on claims that the PDP are not been fair to Southeast on zoning of the presidential ticket.
