A faction of the All Progressive Party led by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Ameachi, has issued a warning to the Abbot-Ogbobua-led faction to desist from its alleged act of lawlessness. This came hours after the faction of the Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress led by Isaac Abbot-Ogbobula suspended three prominent politicians, Daily Times gathered. Spokesman for the Amaechi-led faction, Chief Ogbonna Nwuke, said this in a statement, in Port Harcourt on Sunday.
