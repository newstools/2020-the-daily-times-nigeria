Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has explained reasons he won’t endorse the agitation from Northern governors to improve Almajiri education system, Daily Times reports. Ganduje gave these reasons on Monday, December 7, while declaring open, a 3-day retreat organised by the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) in Kano. He said,  “From the survey we have conducted, most of the “Almajiri” roaming our streets are from Niger, Chad and the northern part of Cameroun. “Once you improve the quality of ‘Almajiri’ education system, you are inviting other ‘Almajiri’ from other places to come to your state.That is another problem.
