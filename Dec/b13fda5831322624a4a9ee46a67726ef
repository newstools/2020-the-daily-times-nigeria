By Mutiat Alli, Lagos The deaf community in Nigeria is one of the fortunate few to be ending an otherwise tumultuous year on a high note, thanks to the Toni and Tosin Foundation who celebrated Christmas with over 600 deaf and hearing impaired children across the country by distributing gifts, school supplies as well as food and drinks to students and pupils in 3 schools for the deaf. The Christmas celebrations took place in Christian Mission School for the Deaf, Ibadan, Ajofa Special Education Foundation for the Deaf, Mowe and the Kwara State School for Special Needs, Ilorin. The Toni and Tosin Foundation is a charitable organisation based in the UK set up to bring hope to the Deaf community in Nigeria and to positively transform the lives of Deaf children. It was recently set up by Oyin Kalejaiye, a Mother of 3 boys including identical twin boys who were born profoundly deaf. The challenges she has faced as well as the whole experience with raising her twin boys, Toni and Tosin, inspired her to start the foundation.
