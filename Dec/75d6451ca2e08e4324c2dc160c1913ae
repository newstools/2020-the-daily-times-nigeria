Cesc Fabregas has paid tribute to Olivier Giroud after the Chelsea striker scored four goals to help Frank Lampard’s side smash Sevilla in the Champions League. Giroud scored a ‘perfect hat-trick’ – netting with both feet and his head – as the Premier League club secured a 4-0 victory on Wednesday night. The emphatic win means Chelsea will finish top of Group E regardless of the outcomes of the final group games. Like Giroud, Fabregas also left Arsenal to revive his career at Chelsea and says the French World Cup winner is a ‘real pro’. Daily Times reports that Fabregas tweeted: ‘@_OlivierGiroud_ what a real pro you are mate. All young players should have you as a rol model. Well done once again. ‘And people still wonder why you always end up playing!! Hard work, passion, dedication and real character to always turn things around.’ READ ALSO: Arsenal dealt blow as Houssem Aouar rules out Lyon exit in January Giroud, meanwhile, says it is a ‘great feeling’ to score four goals and star in such an emphatic victory for Chelsea. The Frenchman will hope to now start on Saturday when Lampard’s side return to Premier League action against Leeds United. He said: ‘When you win 4-0 in a Champions League away game it’s always a great feeling and a good performance from the team. ‘We took the game from the front foot and we were efficient up front, especially for me because I scored four goals. ‘I didn’t know until two years ago that you called it a perfect hat-trick, when I scored against Kyiv in Europa League I said what do you mean? It was good, I had good assists though. ‘I will try to carry on like that to finish the good job of the team and it’s always nice to be in the club history and we play football to mark our history so I’m pleased to help the team to win and to score the four goals.’
