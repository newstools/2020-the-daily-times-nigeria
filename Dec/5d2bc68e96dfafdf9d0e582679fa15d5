ASUU members withdrew their services when the government decided to starve them and the government failed to review their condition of services. “If the demands have been met you would have heard. What is happening now is to determine the extent to which the government is planning to meet the demand.” Why he reacted to the reports that ASUU would soon call off the eight-month strike after a meeting with the Minister of Labor and Employment on Friday.
