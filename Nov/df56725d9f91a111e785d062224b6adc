The wife of the newspaper vendor shot and killed by a Department of State Services operative attached to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila,  Josephine Okereke, has disassociated herself from the N500m compensation, made by her husbandâ€™s family. Josephine spoke at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday. Daily Times gathered that the family of Ifeanyichukwu Okereke had written to Gbajabiamila, demanding N500m. Lawyer to the family, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), in a letter dated November 23, 2020, said he was given the mandate to write the letter by the father of the deceased, Okorie Okereke; and the younger brother to the deceased, Destiny Okereke. The DSS had last week arrested the operative, Abdullahi Hassan, who shot Okereke while Gbajabiamila had also visited the family of the deceased and promised to ensure that they do not suffer.
