Mr Oyerinde urged parents and guardians to warn their wards against the use of fireworks, saying that the law banning the use of fireworks is still in force and security agencies in Lagos State will arrest those selling and distributing the device in the markets. The Special Adviser who disclosed this in his office said that CBD enforcement officers and other security agencies have been mandated to ensure that fireworks were totally removed especially within the markets and residential area. “Some fireworks have the same sound as some of the guns criminals uses and people cannot differentiate them.
