Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, revealed that the landlord of the property where the Nigerian Embassy in Hungary is situated, is threatening to evict them over rent, Daily Times gathered. Onyeama made this disclosure in defense of the ministry’s 2021 budget at the House of Representatives in Abuja on Tuesday. The Minister also claimed the ministry needs N1.6billion to move ambassadors and pay officers N3.7billion. “Just on Monday, the ambassador in Hungary called to say they are going to throw them out from the chancery building. That the landlord is coming and that they do not have the money to pay,” NAN quoted him to have said. “And we get that from a lot of missions across the world and that is not a sustainable way of running foreign service. “Then this exchange rate differential with the CBN is really something we need to address once and for all. “It is not so easy, all of these things are computed in naira and all the payments abroad are in dollars and once the exchange rate is changed, it never goes the other way, it always goes up, it never comes down vis-a-vis the dollar. This means immediate shortfall for all our missions.” READ ALSO: Nigeria’s debt profile to hit N38.68 trillion in 2021
