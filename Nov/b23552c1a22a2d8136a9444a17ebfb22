He said that with the Unity Colleges now 110, admissions carrying capacity has been shored up to 26,625 for the current academic year. Adamu said, “I understand that a total of 70,580 candidates sat for the examination, out of which 24,416 candidates passed, scoring a minimum of 66. I noted also that the total carrying capacity of our 110 Unity Colleges now stands 26,625, having added 720 slots with the establishment of six more Federal Science and Technical Colleges across the six geopolitical zones. “As has been the tradition for decades, the admission criteria include 60 per cent strictly on merit, 30 per cent based on states’ representation in the Unity Colleges and the remaining 10 per cent to cover other sundry considerations such as special needs candidates, gender, local community and biological children of teachers, PTA, SBMC and old students organizations, etc. “Consequently, in this year’s admission, the 60 per cent merit based on admission will come first, followed by the 30 per cent equality of States and 10 per cent discretion. “I have, therefore, directed that within 72 hours of the receipt of the results, principals are to complete both the merit-based (60 per cent) and 30 per cent of equality of states admission. “The selection meeting to be held at a designated date and venue will deal with the shopping and swapping of candidates to meet the 30 per cent states representation as much as possible.”
