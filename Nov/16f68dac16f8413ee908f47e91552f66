The Presidency has stated that looters of public and private properties during the #EndSARS protest will face the law for the destruction of lives and properties in the country. Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President,  made this known on Sunday while featuring on Channels Television’s programme, Sunday Politics. He said, “This country has only one president and has only one constitution. President Muhammadu Buhari is responsible for his government. The buck stops on his table. “We are a country governed by law. There is a constitution —under section 33— that clearly defines the rights of citizens to freely protest in a peaceful way but where a peaceful protest turns into riot, violence and looting, there is a law and order duty to be performed.

Daily Times recalls that the Central Bank of Nigeria froze the accounts of 20 #EndSARS champions while another promoter of the movement, Modupe Odele, was prevented from travelling last week and had her passport seized by the Nigeria Immigration Service.
