He pleaded with the residents to let the seed of peace being sown to sprout, while also stressing the need to revive the communication links between the government and the citizens. Daily Times reports that he said, “We have to reignite the communication link between government and the people so that fifth columnists or conspiracy theorists will not be able to infiltrate and spread disinformation and misinformation that would jeopardise the future of our country or the opportunities available for our youths to contribute to the greatness of our country.” The forum later moved into an executive session where discussions were held on ways out of the current situation. The participants, in the 15-point communiqué issued after the meeting, called on the Federal Government to treat Lagos security as a national issue. They also called for increased intelligence gatherings by security agencies by working with neighborhood securities. They pushed for job creation for the youth, including reintroduction of value-driven programs, such as Boy Scouts, Girl Guild, “in our schools to meaningfully engage young people.”
