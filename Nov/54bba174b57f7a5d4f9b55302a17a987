Oby Ezekwesili, has confirmed that she rejected the offer to be President Muhammadu Buhari’s running mate during the 2011 general elections, Daily Times gathered. Ezekwesili said she did not “waste a moment in saying no” although she did not give reasons for her decision. Buhari contested and lost the presidential election in 2003, 2007 and 2011. However, he defeated incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015, to assume the highest office in the land for the second term. The senior pastor of the Citadel Global Community Church, Tunde Bakare, earlier this week revealed that current vice-president, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, Oby Ezekwesili, Jimi Agbaje, current Minister of Trade and Industry, Niyi Adebayo, were among those approached to run with Buhari. Oby Ezewesili made this disclosure in a tweet on Tuesday: “Many People: Please tell us, is it true you actually rejected the offer to be Vice Presidential Candidate to Buhari as Pastor Bakare @T_Bakare said? Me: Yes it is true. Any more questions? “I laughed at the many messages people sent me upon reading @T_Bakare ‘s factual statement that I rejected running as VP with @MBuhari in 2011. “I did not waste a moment in saying No. “It is why I have always pitied those who spend their years lying against me,” READ ALSO: Ondo APC accuses Jegede, PDP of seeking sympathy after guber poll
