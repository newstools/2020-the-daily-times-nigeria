Wondering why Amaechi was never part of such a crucial stakeholders’ meeting that has to do with the Southsouth geopolitical zone. The APC said the Transportation Minister cannot justify his absence, which it described as “unfortunate.” The meeting had in attendance most presidential appointees from the region and elected representatives. Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, the Chief of Staff to the President, led the presidential delegation comprising ministers from the South-South.
