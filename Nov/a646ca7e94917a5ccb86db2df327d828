The Igbo youth group, also disowned the acclaimed activist, saying that the claimer was not known in their fold or in the South East geopolitical zones, according to statement made available to our correspondent in Kaduna. In a statement issued Wednesday by its President General, Maduabuchi Nwodo, the body appealed to Nigerians to disregard the antics of Mr Okeke and his alleged sponsors. It also dissociated President Muhammad Buhari from the action alleging that Mr. Okeke, was being sponsored by fifth columnists to paint the President and his administration black in the eyes of the world. The Igbo group expressed shock over Mr. Okeke’s action, describing it as not only ill –timed, but also mischievous. The Igbo Youth Professionals said contrary to the picture being painted by Mr. Okeke, his action had no blessings of the people of South East extraction, insisting that he was alone in his game.
