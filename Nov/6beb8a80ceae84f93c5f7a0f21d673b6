Amina Mohammed, the United Nations, UN, Deputy Secretary-General, has attributed the End SARS protests to COVID-19 and unemployment. The former Minister of Environment in Nigeria insists the compounding effects of COVID-19 pandemic was responsible for the protests. She stated this during her meeting with the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo at the State House. According to Mohammed: “I have to say that there are lots of protests around the world that have been exacerbated by COVID and this is because COVID has left people out of work, left people hopeless because of the socio-economic impact and in many of those protests, we have not seen governments turn around in response as quickly as this government did.” Mohammed also commended the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government for accepting the conditions of protesters. “We have not seen governments turn around in response as quickly as this government did,” she said. Her remark is coming at a time some Nigerian youths took to the streets to protest against police brutality and bad governance. The peaceful protest was, however, hijacked by hoodlums who took advantage to loot private and public properties in Nigeria.
