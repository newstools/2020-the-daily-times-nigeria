The White House Press Secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, has insisted that it is just the beginning of the legal battle to contest Joe Biden’s victory in the US election, Daily Times gathered. “This election is not over. Far from it,” McEnany told a news conference on Monday according to BBC. She repeated her principal, President Donald Trump’s allegations of election “fraud”, “irregularities” and “Shenanigans”. McEnany, a Republican, urged reporters to help investigate the allegations of electoral corruption. She said, “We have only begun the process of obtaining an accurate, honest vote count.” She claimed that election officials in the key battleground states had allowed “a disproportionate number of Democrats to correct, or cure, inaccurately filled-out ballots.” Also, the Chairwoman of the Republican Party’s National Committee (RNC) Ronna McDaniel said the party had collected 131 affidavits, or signed legal statements under oath, in Michigan as part of their investigation into alleged election irregularities. She said, “If the shoe were on the other foot…, “if it were this close the other way, if President Trump was in the lead in all these states, and the media would be screaming. This isn’t over.” READ ALSO: Ahmed Musa leads Eagles to Benin camp
