The senator representing Kogi west, Smart Adeyemi has said that he will sponsor bills for the enactment of the Mosaic law as a measure to curb corruption in the country. Adeyemi said this while speaking at a  retreat for the senate press corps in Lokoja, Kogi state, on Saturday, October 3. Adeyemi said public officers will not steal if their hands are cut off. Daily Times gathered that the Mosaic law is ascribed to Moses in the old testament of the Bible. He wrote the 12 testaments which guided Israel at the time. The senator said the law will deter people from stealing. “Like I said on the floor of the senate; if we want this country to be great, we must look at some acts of parliament; moreso the ones that have to do with anti-graft agencies. I want my children to be happier than I am in Nigeria, and to do that there must be enough money to meet the needs and aspirations of the people.
