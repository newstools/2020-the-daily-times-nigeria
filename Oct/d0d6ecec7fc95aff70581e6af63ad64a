The Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has stated that investigations will soon commence to reveal the sources of looted items. According to a statement released on its website on Tuesday, October 27,  the probe was necessitated by the looting spree that ensued as a result of the protests across the country. Daily Times gathered that the probe came as a result of calls from Nigerians to investigate and uncover the rationale behind the storage of palliative materials meant for the masses in warehouses across the country. The anti-corruption agency also said agencies and ministries responsible for the distribution of COVID-19 palliative relief materials would be probed. The statement read, “It should be recalled that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Commission had earlier in the year taken proactive measures to prevent corruption in the administration of the COVID-19 funds by setting up a monitoring team that was charged with the responsibility of preventing possible abuse.
