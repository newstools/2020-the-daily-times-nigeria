The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye has called for the restructuring of Nigeria, Daily Times gathered. He made this statement while speaking at a symposium to mark the 60th Independence anniversary put together by the RCCG and the Nehemiah Leadership Institute on Saturday. Pastor Adeboye said restructuring Nigeria is a matter of urgency if the nation wants to avoid disintegration. The cleric said: “Why can’t we have a system of government that will create what I will call the United States of Nigeria? Let me explain. We all know that we must restructure. It is either we restructure or we break, you don’t have to be a prophet to know that one. That is certain – restructure or we break up. “Now, we don’t want to break up, God forbid. In restructuring, why don’t we have a Nigerian kind of democracy? At the federal level, why don’t we have a President and a Prime Minister?” Adeboye also added that the place of traditional rulers must be re-evaluated as they are “the actual landlords” that “control the respect of their people”.
