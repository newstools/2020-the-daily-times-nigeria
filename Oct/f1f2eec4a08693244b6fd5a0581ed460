Former Commissioner of Police, Fulani Kwajafa, has given reasons for championing the establishment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria Police Force. Kwajafa who expressed regrets for creating SARS in an interview with BBC Hausa, reacted to the protests across Nigeria for over one week now with demonstators demanding a reform of the entire police system. Daily Times reports that extra-judicial killings by SARS officials sparked the protest. He said, “My name is Fulani Kwajafa. I entered the Nigeria Police Force in 1984. Then robbery was prevalent, this was why Buhari was Head of State. He (Buhari) got a lot of complaint that people were stealing from each other, robbing people — he told me and Mr Inyang, the then IGP, that we must do something about it or be fired. “Mr Inyang called me and told me to come up with a plan to save the country from thieves, so I said okay. I told him to give me his trust, resources and officers to start work.

There are laws and no one will give an order that if you see armed robbers kill the person. “I have been hearing disheartening news, to the extent that I have thought to myself that it seems among the SARS officials, there are armed robbers. “This is not why we created SARS, the reason is completely different, this is not the purpose. In fact, when I am mentioned as the creator of SARS, I feel ashamed. It’s a thing of regret for me. “If I had known it would be like this, I wouldn’t have created it because people who know when I established the unit always say to be, is it not Kwajafa’s baby? But this is not what I birthed, it has been changed.”
