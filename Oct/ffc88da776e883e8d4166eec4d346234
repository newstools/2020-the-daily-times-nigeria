He also clarified that the cameras that were removed before the shooting, were ‘low-level cameras that pick car tags when they approach the toll gate’. “Nobody removed the security cameras at Lekki Toll gate. They are intact,” he said Amnesty International and other campaigners have said at least 12 people were killed by soldiers and police in two locations in the city. The Nigerian army has dismissed the reports as “fake news”.
