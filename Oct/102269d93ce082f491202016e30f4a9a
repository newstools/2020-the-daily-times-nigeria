The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto, Matthew Kukah, has condemned President Muhammadu Buhari’s style of leadership, adding that he is not happy as a Nigerian, Daily Times reports. Speaking at The Platform, an annual conference organised by Covenant Christian Centre in Lagos, Kukah said that he is not a happy Nigerian but remained hopeful. He said, “I think even the most optimistic Nigerian must conceive that we are nowhere near coming to define the real sense of democracy. Beyond just going through the process of cycles of election, we have a very serious problem with recruitment methods. “Reflecting federal character should be like viewing ourselves in the mirror and celebrating our diversity because the table is big enough to occupy everyone.

And Nigerians will concede that a reward system that is so skewed, whether in favour of men, women, Christians or Muslims is unacceptable because when it was time to vote, all of us came out to vote. “We need to very quickly reset the template if we are to take our place after 60 years of independence. If we are unable to provide our people with water, food, light, security, then it is a tough call. I am not a happy Nigerian but I remain a hopeful Nigerian.”
