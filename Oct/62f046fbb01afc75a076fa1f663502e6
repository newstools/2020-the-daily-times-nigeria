The Commissioner of Police in Rivers state, Joseph Mukan, has ordered members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra to relocate from the state or risk being treated as terrorists. In a statement signed by Nnamdi Omoni, the CP  gave the warning after meeting with Divisional Police Officers and head of departments of the tactical units in the command on Thursday, October 29. The CP also declared war against the miscreants who attacked and looted public and private properties, as well as burnt police stations, with three policemen hacked to death in the Oyigbo Local Government Area of the state.

The statement reads in part, “The CP further warns members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra to relocate from the, state as machineries have been put in place to fish them out and deal with them as a terrorist group. “Again, the CP, for the umpteenth time, wishes to reiterate emphatically that Rivers State is not an IPOB state and will deal decisively with any group that carries out activities under that guise or any guise whatsoever. “IPOB has been outlawed by both the federal and state governments and to that extent it is non-existent anywhere else, including Rivers State.” The CP, however, urged parents and guardians in the state to caution their children and wards to be law-abiding or face the full wrath of the law. Mukan enjoined residents of the state to increase their security consciousness and report any suspicious character as well as the whereabouts of looted property to the nearest police station.
