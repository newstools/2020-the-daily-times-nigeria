Our economy is too fragile to bear another round of lockdown,” @MBuhari tweeted. Daily Times reports that in March, the president imposed a total lockdown in  Lagos, Abuja and Ogun. The lockdown lasted for over five weeks and had a tremendous effect on the country’s economical activities with the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry putting the loss at about N3bn in the period under review. The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 had at its many briefings frowned on the disregard for COVID-19 protocol by Nigerians while warning against a second wave of the virus in the country. According to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, the country has recorded over 62,000 infections including over 1,100 fatalities.
