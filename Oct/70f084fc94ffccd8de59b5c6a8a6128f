By Patrick Okohue Chairman of the Ondo chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Ade Adetimehin, has appealed to all political actors in the October 10 governorship election in the state to play the game by the rules and avoid anything that could lead to bloodletting. Adetimehin in a press statement signed by the party’s publicity secretary, Mr. Alex Kalejaye to congratulate the government and people of Nigeria and Ondo State in particular, on the occasion of the nation’s diamond anniversary, said he was confident that the election will be peaceful and devoid of any untoward incidents. The party chieftain expressed delight that Nigeria has made tremendous progress, especially in expanding the economy, as well as getting international recognition, despite the many challenges the country has faced. Calling on individuals across the country to make their own contributions to strengthen democracy in Nigeria, the APC chieftain appealed to government at all levels to expand their frontiers in engagement with different strata of the society to promote social harmony.
