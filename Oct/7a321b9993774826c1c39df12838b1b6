The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has blamed Arise, AIT and Channels TV for escalating the violence that followed the #EndSARS protest. They also lauded the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) for sanctioning three broadcast media stations for their coverage of End SARS protests, Daily Times gathered. A statement on Friday by the Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju and the Secretary, Cassidy Madueke, claimed the organisations breached extant regulatory guidelines. BMO aligned with NBC’s position that Arise TV, AIT and Channels TV contributed to the escalation of the crisis. The body noted that the sanction sends a strong and unambiguous message to the broadcast industry in Nigeria. “There can be no justification for Channels Television, Arise TV, and AIT to transmit footage obtained from unverified and unauthenticated social media sources,” it said. BMO said the “amateurish conduct” only fell short of professional expectations. It said their conduct “incited the youth to more violent behaviour”. “They helped create a self-serving justification for the humungous looting spree that gripped many parts of the country. We commend the NBC for exercising obvious and strong regulatory surveillance over the broadcast industry and encourage the Commission to continue in this line”, the statement read. The BMO noted that holding the broadcast stations liable for their breach of the code emanating from the use of material from User Generated Sources was not good enough. On the other hand, Nigerians and groups have condemned the fine slammed on the stations. READ ALSO: TVC recounts losses, says 250 staff now jobless
