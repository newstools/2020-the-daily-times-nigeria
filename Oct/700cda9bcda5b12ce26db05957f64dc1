A Fulani man, Alkassim Adams, who converted to Christianity in Plateau State, has gone missing days after visiting his family house in Rankum Village. Adams went home for the first time in months for the burial of his father on Monday, October 5, 2020, along with two of his friends and fellow Fulani converts but never returned. The three were abducted and threatened with death to renounce their faith. When they resisted, the two were shot on the spot while Adams was taken away.
