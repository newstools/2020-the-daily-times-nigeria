He also promised to ensure that all those who are responsible for the misconduct or wrongful acts are brought to justice. The President’s reaction is coming hours after the Inspector General of Police (IGP) announced the dissolving of SARS operations. The IGP made the announcement on Sunday following protests across the country protesting police brutality and harassment of youths by the SARS operatives. The protests, however, continued across the nation on Monday with the campaigners demanding the mmediate release of all arrested protesters; justice for deceased victims of police brutality and appropriate compensation for their families; setting up an independent body to oversee the investigation and prosecution of all reports of police misconduct among others.
