Femi Kuti, an Afro-beat musician legend and son of Afro-beat founder, Fela Kuti, has condemned the activities of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), Daily Times gathered. Police SARS has been allegedly harassing and killing Nigerians. Their actions have led to a general outcry by Nigerians that Police SARS should be banned. Femi Kuti has also called for an overhauling of SARS on his Twitter page, querying the government for keeping mute about the death of innocent Nigerians. According to him, the government is nonchalant because their families are safe from SARS harassment. His tweet read: “How many more innocent people must SARS/the police kill before urgent steps are taken to completely overhaul and reform the entire police force? “Obviously, government and their families are safe, and that is why they are nonchalant and indifferent.” READ ALSO: IGP partners auditor general in curbing financial fraud
