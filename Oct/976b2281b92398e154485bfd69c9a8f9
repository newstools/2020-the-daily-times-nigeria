President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over a vehicle accident that claimed lives, including those of pupils of Presentation Nursery and Primary School in Mgbowu, Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State, Daily Times gathered. Buhari’s condolence message was contained in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, titled “President Buhari mourns victims of Enugu crash involving pupils.” In mourning the victims, Adesina quoted Buhari as urging vehicle owners to ensure roadworthiness, as initial reports attributed the accident to brake-failure by the truck involved.
