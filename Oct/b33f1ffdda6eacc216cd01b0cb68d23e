Macron condemned the attack on teacher Samuel Paty, 47, who was stabbed and beheaded on his way home from his high school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, around 40 kilometres north west of Paris. The French president described the incident as an “Islamic terrorist attack”. He also added: “Unity and firmness are the only answers to the monstrosity of Islamist terrorism.” There was no suggestion Pogba supports the terrorists’ actions, but Arabic sports website 195.sports.com alleged the midfielder resented Macron’s description of it as an “Islamic” terror attack. Paty, it has been claimed, was targeted for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his students.
