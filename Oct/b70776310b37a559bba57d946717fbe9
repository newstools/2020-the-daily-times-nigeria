In an open letter to the police on Facebook, a woman, Safiya Musa, apologised on behalf of Nigerians who demonised the service and grouped all operatives in the ‘bad eggs’ basket. She wrote: “Dear Nigeria Police Force, please we apologise on behalf of Nigerians who demonised you. They put everyone in the ‘bad eggs’ basket, and for this we say sorry. “Now we know how important you guys are, and we’ve realised that not all of you are bad. “Please stop being angry and help protect lives and property, while you get rid of the bad eggs among you. We know many of you have low morale at the moment, but please think of Nigeria.” Officials of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) and the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) were also not seen in parts of the state visited by our reporter.
