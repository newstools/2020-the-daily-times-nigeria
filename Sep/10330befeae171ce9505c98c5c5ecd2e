Airlines must ensure compliance with this requirement. “Flying passengers that do not have a negative COVID-19-19 PCR test to Nigeria will attract a penalty of $3,500 per passenger”. ” Airlines are hereby notified that the presentation of evidence of payment receipt in the form of a QR code is recommended for all passengers but is not a MANDATORY requirement for boarding flights to Nigeria for now. ‘Airlines are advised to allow passengers without a QR code to board as a temporary measure until additional ongoing work to the payment platform is completed. Airlines will be informed in the coming days of any changes to this requirement.” Daily Times had reported that the Federal government said that passengers who fail to comply with the Covid-19 protocol will be banned for six months.
