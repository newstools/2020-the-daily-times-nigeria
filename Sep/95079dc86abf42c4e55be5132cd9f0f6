A group called Leadership and Accountability Initiative, has called on the U.S. and UK government to also place visa ban on officials of the Independent and Electoral Commission (INEC) involved in rigging elections. Daily Times reports that the group made this call in reaction to announcement by the US Government to impose visa ban on some individuals for their actions during the Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections. The United Kingdom also said in a statement that it will not hesitate to take actions against individuals who engage in election violence for the fast approaching 2020 polls in Edo and Ondo states. The group in a statement by its Head of Mission, Nwazuruahu H Shied, and Head of Electoral Matters, Momodu Abraham, said such restrictions should be extended to electoral and security officials.

According to the group, “Therefore, the news of the US Government’s decision to place travel bans on those involved in these anti democratic practices come as great news and a breath of fresh air for our electoral process and we sincerely thank you and hope that these measures would serve as a deterrent to other individuals especially in the upcoming elections in Edo and Ondo states and future elections in Nigeria. “We also wish that you would extend to their families and to security and electoral personnel who actively participate in these undemocratic actions, and also consider confiscating their assets in the US, thereby sending a strong signal to Nigerians and the world on the United State’s stand against corruption.”
