By Saka Bolaji The crisis in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Niger State may have taken a fresh twist. This followed accusations from various factions over the just concluded Local Government Congresses. A group under the auspices of Niger State PDP Card-Carrying Members led by Rt. Hon. Ndanusa Hassan condemned the claim by a rival group that the Senator Hamman Misau-led electoral team absconded with results. Hassan said in Minna that the Misau-led electoral team ran away from inducement because its integrity was at stake. A group, Concerned Peoples Democratic Party Members, led by former Deputy Governor Shem Zagbayi Nuhu had told journalists that the electoral committee sneaked out of Minna at 5:00am on Sunday, leaving behind one of the members of the team who insisted he would wait to collect all results. Hassan said: “The committee from the national body ran away because the Dr. Shem Zagbayi Nuhu-led group tried to induce them.

That was why they ran away to Abuja.” He added: “We want to make it categorically clear that Dr. Nuhu Zagbayi and his team have ulterior motives to destroy our party and we will not fold our arms to watch him destroy PDP in Niger State.”
