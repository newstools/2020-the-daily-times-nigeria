He said that removal of the petrol subsidy would promote  healthy competition in the upstream petroleum sector and ensure constant availability of the product. Ezeemo, an entrepreneur, told newsmen in Awka on Saturday, that removal of the petrol subsidy would also positively stimulate the country’s economy and ensure constant availability of the product. Ezeemo advised the federal government to use the funds going into fuel subsidy to grow other sectors of the economy. “I am looking forward to seeing that other sectors like road infrastructure, building of low cost houses for the citizenry, enhanced healthcare delivery education among others will now receive due attention,” he said. The PDP chieftain urged Nigerians to bear the temporary hardship the policy would create and make a sacrifice for posterity when everybody would be happy. Nwakpadolu said that workers’ salaries should be made to provide them basic living standard in all ramifications. He also urged the government to ensure proper and judicious use of the funds hitherto been spent on the subsidy. He urged  Nigerians to always support positive government programmes and policies that were people oriented. Daily Times gathered that Mr Christian Beluchukkwu, a block molder  resident in Awka, however, said government should always consider the plight of the masses before taking such decision, and urged it to provide alternatives to cushion its harsh effect.
