At the moment, the INEC register of voters is the largest data base of citizens in Nigeria. “In addition, the combination of biometric voters’ cards commonly known as the Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) and the Smart Card Reader (SCR) have revolutionised the accreditation of voters during elections. “More recently, the introduction of a number of portals has facilitated the seamless nomination of candidates for elective offices by political parties as well as the accreditation of observers and the media. “Most significantly, the Commission now uploads polling unit level results in real-time on Election Day to a portal for public view. “These are significant innovations that have deepened the transparency and credibility of elections and the electoral process in Nigeria”.
