He said, “It is regrettable and disturbing that at a time when Lagosians are suffering from the vagaries of biting economic hardship superintended by the APC government’s policies, the party is deploying Lagos State’s resources to subvert the will of Edo People.” He queried the interest of Tinubu in the outcome of the poll in Edo, noting that the people are resolute in truncating the reign of godfathers in the state. But the APC in Edo State in a statement by the Chairman of the APC Media Campaign Council, Mr John Mayaki, said Nehikhare “fabricated” the story. He said, “The PDP are renowned countrywide for their matchless fabrications. They are masters of falsehood, but whenever Nehikhare gets excited and tries to fabricate one, he overdoes it. It is glaring that the man did not know what he was saying.” “Edo people know that APC has no interest in dishonest politics. What do we stand to gain from buying votes that the people had already promised us? Why would Lagos local government councils raise that kind of money for us? Don’t they have anything to do with money in Lagos?”
