Olivier Giroud has debunked rumours that he will leave Chelsea for Juventus this summer, Daily Times gathered. Reports had earlier emanated from an Italian outlet, Gianluca DiMarzio, that Giroud has reached an agreement in principle with Juventus over a two-year deal at £4.5 million per season.

I’m a Chelsea player, and I feel good here. “I did not have the great end of the season that I did to leave like this and not believe in my chances. “I will fight for my place. But it is always good to get the attention of these kinds of clubs; it is flattering. But I remain focused on Chelsea. “We’ll see what’ll happen in the coming weeks. But there is nothing signed or done. I prefer to deny it.” Giroud, 33, faces competition for a starting spot at Chelsea from summer signings Timo Werner and Kai Havertz, as well as striker Tammy Abraham.
