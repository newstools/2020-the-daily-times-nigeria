By Elijah Odetokun Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin has invested in League Two Forest Green Rovers to become the second largest shareholder of the club, according to the BBC. The club which is recognised by FIFA and the United Nations as the world’s most environmentally friendly team, went fully vegan in 2015 and became the world’s first carbon-neutral sports club in 2017. “Forest Green are showing others the way. So many people feel there’s no solution to the world’s problems, but Forest Green are already doing plenty. “I’m so excited to be part of the FGR family. I’ll be helping where I can, supporting people who want to change the world for the better.” the Spain international said. “When I first played Forest Green Rovers [in a pre-season friendly in 2014], all I knew about them was that it was a long way from London! As I heard more about the club and its work, I knew I wanted to meet them and be part of it.” he further said. Bellerin recently raised money to plant 60,000 trees in the Amazon rainforest. His shareholding is not above a threshold where it would be deemed a conflict of interest.
