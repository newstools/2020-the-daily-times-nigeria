Nigerian investigative journalist, Kiki Mordi  has reacted to the sack of the Nigerian journalist, Oluwatosin Adeshokan working for an African magazine, the Africa Report. The magazine sacked Adeshokan on Friday, September 11, following calls from several women who accused him inappropriate sexual conducts on Twitter. On their different tweets, Daily Times reports that the women alleged that Adeshokan is a sexual Predator, reportedly taking advantage of young feminist women. Kiki Mordi, the lady behind popular Sex for Grades documentary, called out Adeshokan and frowned at the his ill-behaviour.

According to Mordi, Tosin is in the habit of making friends with feminists perhaps to protect him from being called out as a predator. But later on, Adeshokan took to his Twitter to apologize and admit that his actions and behaviours were predatory and disgusting. “In the past few hours, stories about my inappropriate conversations with women have broken,” he said in a note shared on Twitter. “I take absolute responsibility for my behaviour. I admit my actions were wrong and I made these women uncomfortable.” He went on to admit that he had what he called unhealthy conversations with these women and ‘acted unsuitably’. “My actions and behaviours were predatory and disgusting,” he added. Shortly after his apology, The Africa Report also on Twitter revealed that it has parted ways with the documentary maker.
