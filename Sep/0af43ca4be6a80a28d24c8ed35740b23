The “Body Concert” by Ambiguous Dance Company was created to show how much the body can express itself through music. He explained that the choreographer, Kim Bo-ram selected songs that he once wanted to dance as a dancer to form the choreography. “From Daft Punk, a pioneer of Electronic music, to Bach’s ‘Goldberg Variation’ representing Baroque music, and ‘Make Me Cry’ of Handel’s opera, ‘Rinaldo’, a symbol of the Classics, this performance involves music and dance, not bound by genre.
