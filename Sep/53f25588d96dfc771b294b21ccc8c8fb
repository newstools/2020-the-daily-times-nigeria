Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu insisted that the outcome of the forthcoming state governorship election would determine the South-West’s prospects of presidency in 2023. After mobilizing traditional rulers to meet the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, Akeredolu said that. As gathered by Daily Times, this was shortly after commissioning the Revenue House to mark his second term kick-off. While Tinubu is yet to announce if he will run for the top spot, it is assumed that the former governor of Lagos State will be targeting the presidency of 2023. Tinubu’s political foot soldiers are already putting pseudo pressure groups and campaign outfits ahead of the contest.
