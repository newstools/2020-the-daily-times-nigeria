In a statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, President Buhari will also commission a road named in his honour by the host government. According to reports, Nigeria and Guinea Bissau established diplomatic relations in 1974. Following a military coup in that country, Nigeria in 2012 deployed troops under the auspices of ECOWAS Mission in Guinea Bissau (ECOMIB) to maintain peace. President Buhari had in response to a request for assistance by the Government of Guinea Bissau, during its last legislative elections, donated $500,000 dollars, 17 vehicles, and 350 electoral kits to support the country’s electoral process. In May this year, the President received President Embalo in Abuja, during which the Nigerian leader congratulated his counterpart on his confirmation as President, assuring him of Nigeria’s support to the new government in Guinea Bissau. The Nigerian troops were only withdrawn on September 10, 2020, after the return of stability to the West African country. The President will be accompanied by top government officials including the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, the Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Salihi Magashi (Rtd), the National Security Adviser, Major-General Babagana Monguno (Rtd) and the Director-General, National Intelligence Agency, Ahmed Rufai Abubakar. President Buhari will return to Abuja at the end of the ceremonies on Thursday.
