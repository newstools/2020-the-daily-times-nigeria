The Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) has suspended its seven-day Nationwide warning strike. Daily Times recalls that the health workers had embarked on the warning strike on September 14 following the failure of the government to meet their demands. The National President, Biobékentóye Josiah, in a statement, said the health workers comprising five unions under JOHESU and the Assembly of Healthcare Professional Associations (AHPA) were expected to resume work on September 21. “This is to bring to your notice that the 7-day nationwide warning strike embarked upon by the members of the Joint Health Sector Unions JOHESU) would come to end midnight of today, September 20, 2020.
