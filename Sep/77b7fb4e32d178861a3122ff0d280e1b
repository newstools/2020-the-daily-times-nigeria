Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has requested God to let him lose the governorship election on Saturday “if it costs anyone’s blood”. His second term ambition, according to the governor, who will stand for re-election under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) platform, is not worth spilling the blood of anyone. As gathered by Daily Times, he made these remarks in a statement titled, ‘My reelection not worth spilling of blood – Obaseki’ and signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Crusoe Osagie. The Governor, whose major opponent is Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), urged eligible voters to come out en masse to vote, without fear of intimidation or harassment. “Election should not be one in which we shed blood because the election will always come. If you die in an election, you will not be there in the next one to vote. So, there is no need for violence.
