Another debutant, Gabriel, who seemed to command his defensive duties with ease and confidence, made a telling contribution at the other end four minutes into the second half, diverting Willian’s corner with his shoulder into the net. Arsenal went 3-0 up before the hour mark, with Willian playing another contributory role by teeing up Aubameyang who produced a fine, curling finish into the top-right corner to beat Rodak in goal. Mikel Arteta’s men will be beaming with confidence following a magnificent all-round display, which consolidates upon Arsenal’s strong finish to the 2019/2020 season which saw them clinch a record-extending 14th FA Cup title and this year’s edition of the FA Community Shield, a laconic message from the Gunners that the club’s ammunitions which saw them establish dominance in the early 2000s could be firing on all cylinders again.
