The Ondo State House of Assembly, on Tuesday, dismissed claims that the distribution of operational vehicles by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu was politically motivated, according to findings by Daily Times. Akeredolu had last week presented 2020 model KIA Sportage SUVs to 19 members of the Assembly as official vehicles in fulfillment of an earlier promise, omitting seven lawmakers in the distribution. The seven Ondo lawmakers, who have yet to benefit from the largesse, alleged that they were deliberately sidelined for refusing to support a move to impeach the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi.

The governor gave everyone. Two members of the PDP got. So, if it is political, there is no way the PDP lawmakers will get. So, nothing like politics in it.”
