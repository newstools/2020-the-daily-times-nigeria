Ground and an aerial manhunt are underway in northeast Uganda where 200 inmates overpowered their guards and escaped with weapons after a shootout, the country’s prison commissioner told AFP on Thursday. The prisoners seized guns from the armory at a government prison in Moroto, about 460 kilometers (286 miles) from Kampala, before dashing for the cover of nearby mountains, said commissioner Johnson Byabashaija of Wednesday’s breakout. “About 215 inmates are still on the run. The Uganda prison service, working with the police and the army with support from the ground and air assets, have been deployed to rearrest the inmates,” he said.

As gathered by Daily Times, some of the inmates had shed their bright yellow jumpsuits to avoid aerial detection and were on foot half-naked, prison spokesman Frank Baine said. He said the jailbreak was “one of the rarest cases of its kind in the history of Uganda’s Prison Service”. (AFP)
