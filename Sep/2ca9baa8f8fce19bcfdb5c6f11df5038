The African Action Congress (AAC), Ondo State Chapter, has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a thorough investigation into the recent fire outbreak at the commission’s office in Ondo State. Reacting to the incidence, the AAC berated the electoral commission “on the poor management of multimillion naira facilities of the Nigerian people in their care”, adding that INEC must ensure the governorship election was free, fair and credible. “How will INEC justify as mere coincidence that materials of such value and importance in the election, which is peculiar to the credibility of votes, got conflated just a month to the governorship election, despite the fact that the materials have been at the location for a period of time,” the AAC questioned.
