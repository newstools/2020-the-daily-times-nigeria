Buhari, tell us what we have done to deserve this punishment. “They are now justifying why they don’t want COVID-19 to disappear in Nigeria. Why must you allow only private laboratories to carry out tests when there are public ones? “What did they use the billions of Naira they spent on COVID-19 for? In America today, without any health insurance, COVID-19 test is free. “President Buhari and others should know that they have limited time, and the world is watching them.”
