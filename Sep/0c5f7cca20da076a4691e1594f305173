Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to use the Edo State governorship election to restore hope in Nigeria’s electoral process, Daily Times gathered. He said this via a statement on Thursday revealed by Paulinus Nsirim, Rivers State Commissioner for Information. Wike, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Campaign Council Chairman, stated that the outcome of the election would provide hope for the general elections of 2023. He alleged that “The agenda of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is to win at all cost for us to go to the tribunal”. “Let every one that loves this country ensure that the Sept. 19, 2020 election is credible, free and fair. The Police and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), should show Nigerians that they can support credible elections. “INEC should ensure that result sheets are not in the hands of individuals. Security Agencies should not whisk away collation officers and later bring them back with cooked results. Complete manipulation of the electoral process causes violence.” Wike stated that no politician will cause violence if the Police and INEC do not compromise. He predicted a high turnout of voters on Saturday, adding that Edo people were eager to end godfatherism. The governor said money or intimidation would not stop voters from voting massively for Obaseki. READ ALSO: From 1914, Nigeria has always been divided — Presidency replies Soyinka
