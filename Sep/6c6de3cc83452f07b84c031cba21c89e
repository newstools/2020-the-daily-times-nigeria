The Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde has received warnings from the former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose to steer clear of the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Ekiti and other southwest States. Fayose made this statement on Wednesday during a meeting of the National delegates of the PDP in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The meeting was held at the Ogun PDP secretariat in Abeokuta and had in attendance the Chairman of the party in Ekiti, Osun, Lagos, and Ogun. Speaking at the southwest zonal meeting, Fayose maintained that Makinde had no right to dabble into the local politics in each State of the South West.

Fayose said he will be ready to fight anyone who plans to take over the structure of the Ekiti PDP from him. He alleged that Makinde demanded that the zonal executive should be dissolved for a caretaker committee, adding that since the caretaker committee came on board, Makinde “has not allowed them to function because he produced the chairman.” While stressing that he would continue to respect the Oyo State Governor as a brother whom he loves, Fayose stated that being a sitting governor does not give Makinde the right to go to another man’s State. He said, “Nobody should come to my State; if you come to my State, I will face you squarely.” The meeting, Daily Times reports, was attended by Engr Deji Doherty, Sikirullahi Ogundele, Sunday Olatunde Akanfe, and Bisi Kolawole – the PDP Chairmen for Lagos, Ogun, Osun, and Ekiti states respectively. In a communique signed after the meeting, the PDP in the South West resolved that no State chapter of the party should be ruled by another.
