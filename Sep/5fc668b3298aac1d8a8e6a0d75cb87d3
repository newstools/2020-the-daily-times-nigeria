By Mutiat Alli Following the soaring numbers of King Samba’s latest single, ‘Ogun esu wo’, the singer has expressed his marvel at the song’s reception. It appears that the song is gradually growing into a big one due to its acceptance by Christians and the streaming stats which seems to be running into millions. Speaking to R, the US-based gospel artiste disclosed that the new song wasn’t really new due to the fact that he had recorded it almost seven years ago before he left for the United States. “I wrote the song almost seven years ago when I was in Lagos and I took it to my church during our choir rehearsal, they heard the song and started jumping up and down with joy but to my greatest surprise, they didn’t include the song in the final list. So, a member of the choir called me after the rehearsal and encouraged me to record the song for myself.” After releasing the single years after, despite the reception it got from his fellow choristers in Lagos, King Samba didn’t anticipate such global attention for his song with Christians and music lovers across Nigeria and the United embracing the single.
