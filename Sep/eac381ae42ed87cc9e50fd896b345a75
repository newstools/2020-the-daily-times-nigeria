Mr. Bisi Kolawole, chairman of the faction of the People’s Democratic Party’s (PDP) Ekiti State chapter loyal to former Governor Ayodele Fayose, said on Monday that the party would for now refrain from suspending members. He said the PDP is now concentrating more on reconciling aggrieved members to increase its membership base. Kolawole said his agenda was to unite the party and reposition it with that, in the interests of Ekiti people, to win the governorship poll in 2022. As gathered by Daily Times, this was contained in a statement titled, ‘It is bye-bye to APC in Ekiti come 2022 – PDP Chairman’, signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Bola Agboola, in Ado Ekiti. Kolawole was quoted as saying, “We are not going to suspend any member unless such member proves beyond every reasonable doubt that he or she is against the success of the PDP.

The State Working Committee will ensure all tendencies in the party are brought together to achieve success. “The spirit, as I speak, is to bring people into the party; not suspend members, unless you are determined to leave the party, we are not willing to send you out of the party. I don’t belong to that school of thought for now.”
