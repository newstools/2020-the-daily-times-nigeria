Activist, Yinka Odumakin, says All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, Bola Tinubu, should have stood up to greet the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, at the coronation of the Oniru of Iruland, Oba Omogbolahan Lawal. Odumakin, who is also the spokesman for the pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere, said this in an interview with The PUNCH on Wednesday while reacting to a viral picture showing Tinubu sitting down while the Ooni stands to greet him.

As gathered by Daily Times, the activist recalled that in 2016, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is many years older than the monarch, bowed down to greet him. Odumakin stated, “We are still Yoruba people. With due respect to our royal fathers, we should not say because we are in a modern age, we should not give the proper respect that we give to our oba. “You saw the time former President Obasanjo prostrated before the Ooni. “So, it is still our culture and we must sustain our culture and give the respect that is due to our monarchs.”
