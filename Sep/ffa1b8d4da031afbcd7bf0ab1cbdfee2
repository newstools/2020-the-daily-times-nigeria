The 22-year old attacker had huge prospects before joining Genk but the move didn’t go as expected as he had to spend a lot of time on the bench. The Belgian club signed new Super Eagles invitee, Cyriel Dessers at the beginning of the summer, in a move that further limited the Odey’s chances. Odey broke out of the Nigeria Professional Football League in 2018, as he shone for MFM in the league before making a move to Europe.
