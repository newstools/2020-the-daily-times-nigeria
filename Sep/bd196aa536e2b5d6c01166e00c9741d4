Elderly women and men turned out impressively,” he said. “The turnout showed that people have shown that they are ready for democracy. My only disappointment so far is that the machine is not working. “The INEC officials have reported but they have not brought a new machine. This exercise is supposed to have a closing time. If they are doing this in my ward, it means that somebody wants to remove the number of voters here. But I have told them (voters) to stay here, they have a right to vote. “Nobody should come here and be unable to vote because of INEC’s failure.
