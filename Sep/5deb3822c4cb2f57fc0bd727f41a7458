He had a choice to ensure his party was declared winner, but insisted that the right thing be done. “I use this opportunity to reach out to our brothers on the other side of the divide as we are one family in the pursuit to provide public good for our citizens. The election shows that they trust us more now to provide leadership. It doesn’t mean the opposition parties don’t have a role to play “I use this opportunity to extend the hands of fellowship to my brother, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and his other colleagues in the APC as well as other parties to join hands with us to move Edo forward. “I call on Adams Oshiomhole that the fight is over and he should come and join in building the house which he was part of, in laying the foundation. We have no malice, but only disagree on the approach in moving Edo forward.” The governor commended the leadership of INEC and security agencies for their neutrality and professionalism in carrying out their functions He also made special mention of the members and leaders of his party, the Peoples Democratic Party for their “tenacity and doggedness” in ensuring the party emerged victorious. To the Oba of Benin, he said, “I also thank the Benin Monarch, Omo N’ Oba N’ Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II, for his fatherly role in ensuring that the election was peaceful.
