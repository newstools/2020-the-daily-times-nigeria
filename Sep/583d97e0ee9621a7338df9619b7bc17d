By Tunde Opalana The candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Saturday’s Edo governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu may after all not challenge his defeat at the polls at the election tribunal, Daily Times gathered. This indication arose from a closed-door meeting held Wednesday afternoon at the Abuja residence of the Yobe state governor and the Chairman Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CENCPC) Mai Mala Buni. At the meeting where the Edo election matter was tabled was the Kogi state governor, Yahaya Bello and Pastor Ize-Iyamu. Though the agenda of the meeting was not made public, a source close to Buni said the APC candidate was impressed upon not to seek legal redress over his and the party’s loss in the election. Reiterating the earlier position of the leadership of the APC to accept the result of the poll, Buni, it was learned asked Ize-Iyamu to drop any planned legal action. The party leadership had through a statement signed by Buni congratulated Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The statement titled, “Edo State Governorship Election: Victory for Democracy”, the ruling party noted the “conduct of the election and its outcome represents a victory for Nigeria’s democracy. “The 19th September 2020, Edo State Governorship election is over, the winner has been declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the person of Mr. Godwin Obaseki, candidate of the People Democratic Party (PDP). We hereby congratulate the winner of the election, the people of Edo State and all Nigerians. The peaceful conduct of the election and its outcome represent a victory for Nigeria’s democracy.” The party joined President Muhammadu Buhari, who had on Sunday congratulated the winner of the election.
