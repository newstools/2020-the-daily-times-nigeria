Aherhoke Okioma Members of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly have denied they are plotting to impeach the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Abraham Ngobere. They said claims that Ngobere absconded with the mace to avoid being impeached were figments of imaginations from people who did not mean well for the political stability of the state. Tari Porri, member representing Ekeremor Constituency 1, while moving a motion to reaffirm the confidence of the House on the Speaker, said: “The 6th Assembly has done well under Hon. Abraham Ngobere.” READ ALSO: Benue most wanted gang leader Terwase Agwaza surrenders Minority leader, Chief Samson Awudulu, who seconded the motion, led other members of the Assembly including Hon.
