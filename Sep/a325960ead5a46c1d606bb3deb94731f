ISWAP has recently stepped up attacks on military and civilian targets. On Friday the Islamist militants killed 30 people, including security personnel, when they ambushed the convoy of regional governor Babagana Umara Zulum near Baga, a town on the lake’s shore. At least 36,000 people have been killed and around two million displaced in the decade-long jihadist conflict in Nigeria’s northeast. The violence has spilled into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon, prompting a regional military coalition to be formed to fight the insurgents. AFP
