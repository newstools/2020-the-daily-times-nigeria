When they also failed to effect the correction, we had to go back to the Federal High Court. The court, in its wisdom, directed that all revenue accruing from Soku Oil Well should be paid to Rivers State. “That is the position. For Bayelsa State Governor to come up to say that you should not pay our money is unfortunate. “If they have filed a matter at the Supreme Court, it is not an injunction to stop the implementation of the subsisting judgment.”
