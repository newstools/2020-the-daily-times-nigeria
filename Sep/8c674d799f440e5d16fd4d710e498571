The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has reaffirmed orders it earlier gave to its members concerning the sit-at-home order it declared for October 1, Daily Times gathered. Its spokesman, Emma Powerful, in a statement, on Wednesday, warned the federal government and security agencies to steer clear. He declared that nobody could reverse the call on Igbo people to remain indoors. “Nigeria Police and those claiming to be fighting for Biafra freedom but stand against the coming of Biafra are inconsequential because they cannot afford to stop us.” IPOB said it is working hard for the speedy and successful actualization of Biafra, adding that Nigeria cannot scuttle their resolve. The group urged other ethnic nationalities in Nigeria eager for change to demand freedom. “Our people must be strong to encourage all other ethnic nationalities in Nigeria who wish to change their lives by demanding freedom. Freedom for all oppressed people is what IPOB is all about”, Powerful added. READ ALSO: Trump, Biden clash in chaotic first presidential debate
