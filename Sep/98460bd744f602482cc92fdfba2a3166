The Nigeria Air Force (NAF) has immortalised the late Tolulope Arotile, who was  Nigeria’s first female helicopter combatant pilot. It named a remodelled Pilots Crew Room at the 115 Special Operations Group in Port Harcourt after the late combatant pilot. Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar announced this at the inauguration of the accommodation block at the NAF base in Port Harcourt on Tuesday. Abubakar, who also inaugurated a newly-built Senior Non-Commissioned Officers’ quarters and a water project, praised Arotile for her outstanding contributions to securing the country. He said: “The late Flying Officer, Tolulope Arotile, who was the first female combat helicopter pilot in the history of the Nigeria Air Force, died on July 14, at the age of 24. “It is with mixed feelings that we are having the pilot crew room here at the Nigeria Air Force’s home of combat helicopters, named in her honour.

He said that after the death of Arotile, many young Nigerian girls had since indicated interest in joining the Air Force. “Also, since Arotile’s demise, no fewer than 12 female officers, who have undoubtedly been motivated by her inspirational life, are currently undergoing flying training to become NAF pilots. “So, it could be said that the late flying officer is living in the lives of those coming after her.” “To this end, I encourage more of our young girls to aspire for career opportunities in the Nigeria Air Force, as there is no limit to what they can achieve,” he added. Daily Times reports that Ms Arotile, died on July 14, as a result of head injuries sustained from a road traffic accident at NAF Base Kaduna. The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Thursday, July 23 buried the remains of late Flying Officer Tolulope Arotile, at the National Military Cemetery in Abuja.
