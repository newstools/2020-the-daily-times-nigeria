Over 1,000 Chinese nationals have had their visas revoked by the United States since June, under a program aimed at graduate students and researchers believed to have ties to the Chinese military. The US State Department said in a statement Wednesday, September 9, said that “high-risk graduate students and research scholars” had been expelled. Daily Times gathered that they were expelled after they “were found to be subject to Presidential Proclamation 10043 and therefore ineligible for a visa.” Issued by President Donald Trump at the end of May, and implemented beginning June 1, the proclamation claims that China “is engaged in a wide‑ranging and heavily resourced campaign to acquire sensitive United States technologies and intellectual property, in part to bolster the modernization and capability of its military, the People’s Liberation Army.” READ ALSO:  ‘China would own America under Biden’ – Trump The State Department said the revocation of visas “safeguards US national security by limiting the PRC’s ability to leverage Chinese graduate students and researchers in the United States to steal United States technologies, intellectual property, and information to develop advanced military capabilities.” Speaking on Wednesday, CNN reports that the  acting US Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said that “China has leveraged every aspect of its country including its economy, its military, and its diplomatic power, demonstrating a rejection of western liberal democracy and continually renewing its commitment to remake the world order in its own authoritarian image.” According to the State Department, those affected by the recent expulsions “represent a small subset of the total number of Chinese students and scholars coming to the United States.”
