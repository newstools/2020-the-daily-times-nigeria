Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu Campaign Organization has denied that the All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate in the last election appealed to Governor Godwin Obaseki to return to the party. The Director of Communications and Media of the Osagie Ize-Iyamu’s Campaign Organization, Mr John Mayaki, stated this in a statement on Thursday, September 24. Daily Times recalls that Ize-Iyamu, in a viral video that emerged on Wednesday night appealed on Obaseki, whom he described as his senior brother, to return to the party he left prior to the governorship election in the State.

Were the reporters transported to Abuja? “Do these media agencies actually believe the stories they carry? Obaseki and the PDP have a way of leaking false news to the media and the media has to be sensitive and professional in receiving the news.” He further said that there is a fake Twitter account purporting to belong to Pastor Ize-Iyamu, warning the media to avoid it like a plague and verify all their information before passing them on.
