By Rilwan Balogun Naomi Osaka is riding high again, and the waves are on a wholly different level. In the 2020 US Open finals, the first Asian woman to rise to the summit of female tennis proved her mettle again, as she won her 3rd Grand Slam. Naomi Osaka, 22, is ranked highest in female tennis now and the smiles of victory on her face suggest a lot about her mental framework. After pulling out of the Cincinnati Masters finals against Victoria Azarenka, she rose from her ruins to defeat the Belarusian 1-6 6-3 6-3 at the Flushing Meadows. Daily Times reports that Azarenka was third time unlucky as she was overpowered by a younger Osaka.

Azarenka, one of three mothers to have graced the 2020 US Open pushed the Japanese hard but she survived the night and gave a spectacle. It was the first three-set match in a women’s final since 2016. Osaka is the first woman since 1994 to capture a major title after dropping the first set. It is Osaka’s third Grand-slam, and her second title in New York. She had also previously won the Australian Open in 2019.
