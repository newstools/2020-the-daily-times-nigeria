Following the death of the Emir of Zazzau, four princes from eligible ruling houses of Zazzau Emirate are jostling to replace the Emir. Daily Times had reported that Emir Shehu Idris, 84-year-old, died on Sunday, September 20. Mr Idris spent 45 years on the throne, having ascended the position in 1975 after the death of Muhammadu Aminu, the 17th emir since the 1804 Fulani Jihad. By tradition, a new emir is expected to emerge from any one of the four ruling clans of the emirate. The ruling houses are Katsinawa, Mallawa, Bare-bari and Sullubawa. The late Emir Idris was from the Katsinawa ruling house.
