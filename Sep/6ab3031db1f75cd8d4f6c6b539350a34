The spokesperson for President Muhammadu Buhari, Garba Shehu, told Nigerians that under the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) administration petrol was sold for ₦600 / litre. Shehu tweeted this alongside the front page of a newspaper from Easter Sunday in 2013, in response to PDP claiming citizens may not survive the increment in electricity tariffs and price of petrol. PDP explained that the level of poverty in Nigeria was too high. However, Shehu Garba wrote: “Don’t allow the PDP to deceive you. Amidst acute shortages, they sold petrol at N600 per litre on Easter Sunday in 2013 (See Punch published on that day).” READ ALSO: Fuel price hike: NLC threatens strike, says Buhari betrayed Nigerians’ trust Don't allow the PDP to deceive you.
