Baroness Anne Cox, a member of the British House of Lords, Upper House of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (UK) has written to the Commonwealth, expressing her worry over escalating violence in Nigeria. Cox said this in a letter, addressed to the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Hon. Patricia Scotland, made available to THISDAY on Tuesday, September 22. She stated that Nigeria’s inability to protect its vulnerable citizens was a breach of its obligations under the commonwealth charter. The letter reads in part, “We write to highlight urgent concerns about escalating violence in Nigeria, where attacks led by Boko Haram, Fulani herders, and other Islamist militia continue in northern and central-belt states, with reports of increasing violence in the South-east. “According to a report by the UK All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for International Freedom of Religion or Belief, entitled, ‘Nigeria: Unfolding Genocide?’ thousands of civilians have been killed and elements of the Nigerian government may be complicit in violence.

Gen. Theophilus Danjuma, whom some of us have met and spoken to, says the armed forces are ‘not neutral: they collude’ in the ‘ethnic cleansing in… riverine states’ by Fulani herders. “He insists that villagers must defend themselves because ‘depending on the armed forces will result in them dying ‘one by one. The ethnic cleansing must stop’, the British MP noted, quoting an earlier report. “The state’s failure to protect its citizens is a clear breach of its obligations under the Commonwealth Charter in respect of human rights. “There is now an urgent need to ensure adequate protection and aid for those suffering the loss of family members and the destruction of their homes and livelihoods. “And to end impunity by ensuring that complaints related to human rights violations are promptly, independently, and impartially investigated and those responsible are held to account after fair trials.” “We write, therefore, to ask whether you are able to respond on behalf of the Commonwealth and to raise these urgent concerns with the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group. We would be very willing to meet in person (or perhaps more practically online via zoom) to discuss how we might proceed.” Daily Times gathered that she copied 18 individuals and organisations.
