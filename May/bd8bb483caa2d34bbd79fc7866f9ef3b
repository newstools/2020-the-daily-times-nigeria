The Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has noted that major airports in the country will  reopen soon. NCAA Director-General, Captain Musa Nuhu stated this at a virtual event organised by the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ART) titled COVID-19: The Challenges and Opportunity for Nigeria’s Aviation Value Chain, During and Post. According to  the Nation, Nuhu said the NCAA worked with representatives of  airlines and ground handling companies before forwarding a proposal to the Minister of Aviation for approval. The NCAA boss said: “We may resume domestic operations with four or five airports and we hope to expand as we get better. We don’t want to rush everything at the same time and get it choked up. The airports are the Murtala Mohammed Airport, Ikeja; Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja; Aminu Kano Arport, Kano and the Port Harcourt Airport, Choba, Rivers State. The  Federal Government on March 16 placed a travel ban on 13 countries, including China, United States  and Italy  that had recorded over 1,000 cases of Coronavirus. On March 13 it shut all  airports for one month and later extended it by two weeks. On May 6, the government further extended the airports’ closure by four weeks until June 7. The decision to commence flights at the airports, according to the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), is to avoid chocking the “system.”
