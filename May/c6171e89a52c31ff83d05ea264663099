Kogi state commissioner for Information, Kingsley Fanwo has described the recent results released from the Nigerian Centre for Disease control as being”fraudulent.” In an interview with Channels TV, he  questioned the results of NCDC, saying that it lacked cooperation with the state government and state ministry of health. He noted that the NCDC violated protocols and announced a case unknown to the state government. He stated that he communicated with the son of the index case, but all information given pointed that NCDC’s result is a ”fraud.” ” I am not one of those who think NCDC is helping this country, I think NCDC has an agenda to spread covid-19 to all states of the federation.” he said.
