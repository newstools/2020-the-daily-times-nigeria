Nigerian On-Air Personality, Melody Hassan, has slammed Mercy Eke, over a recent video in which she complained about not getting adequate support from her fans. During a live session on her Instagram page, the reality TV star complained about how American celebrities like Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, Kylie Jenner have armies of devoted fans willing to go all out for them. Wondering why her fans don’t give her same type of support, Mercy Eke gave an example of Kylie Jenner’s skincare products that get sold out so quickly despite claims that they do not work. Many have suggested that Mercy Eke took to social media to complain about her fans because of her recent project Lambo Homes. This hasn’t gone down well with OAP Melody Hassan, who stated that it was wrong for the reality TV star to compare herself with US celebrities. She also accused Mercy Eke of never supporting her fans, and demanding such from them. In her reaction to Mercy’s rant, Melody Hassan wrote,“On this fans not supporting their faves claim in Nigeria and the constant comparison to celebrities in the US, as a celebrity, what do u do for your fans asides from “demanding” for support? You never speak on issues that affect them, u think fans don’t need love or support too?”
