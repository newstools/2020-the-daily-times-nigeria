David Luiz confirms he has held talks with Benfica president Luís Filipe Vieira over a return to the club. The Brazilian stay at the club was coming to a close at the end of the season after signing a 12-month deal with Arsenal from Chelsea with an option to extend the stay for another 12 months. Arsenal is said to be looking to offload the player as they seek to cut some of their highest earners after failing to begin contractual negotiations with the player despite his current deal ending on June 30. The Brazilian admitted on Friday that he has already contacted Vieira and in an interview with Record in Portugal he said: “I already spoke with Vieira about the return.” In the interview, Luiz admitted that it didn’t necessarily mean he has to move back to Portugal this year with reports indicating that he wanted to stay at Arsenal longer; the club set to decide on his future before June 23. “My dream is to end my career at Benfica. When, I don’t know, but it will happen… it will if President Vieira allows me and if the fans want me to come back. It will be one of the most beautiful moments of my career,” he added. Should Luiz leave, Arsenal has the option of replacing him with Flamengo loanee Pablo Mari on a permanent deal this summer and will also welcome William Saliba into the squad this summer.
