Bundesliga giants, Bayern Munich has signed a new three-year-deal with germany international goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Neuer future has been a subject of speculation in recent weeks with the keeper coming out last month to rebuke the way his negotiations with the club had been leaked to the public. Both parties seem to have come to an agreement with the player who joined the Bavarians in 2011 from Schalke expressing his delight at extending his stay at the Allianz Arena. A statement confirming the development on Bayern website noted: “Manuel Neuer, 34, has extended his contract with FC Bayern Munich until June 30th, 2023” The club’s CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said: “FC Bayern are very happy Manuel has extended his contract until June 30th, 2023. Manuel is the best goalkeeper in the world and our captain.” Oliver Kahn, FC Bayern executive board member: “I can easily put myself in the situation Manuel is in. We understand the direction Manuel wants to take in this phase of his career and what’s important to him. He’s sent a strong signal with this extension.” On his part, Neuer said: “During the weeks of the shutdown for the coronavirus pandemic, I didn’t want to make a decision because nobody knew if, when and how Bundesliga football would continue. “It was important for me to continue working with our goalkeeping coach Toni Tapalovic. Now, this has been resolved, I look to the future with great optimism. I feel very comfortable and at home in Bavaria. FC Bayern is one of Europe’s top football clubs.”
