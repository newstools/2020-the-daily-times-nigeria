The State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) have confirmed detaining prolific video director Clarence Peters over the death of dancer, Love Divines alias Kodak at his Omole Phase One residence, Lagos. The late Kodak was said to have been electrocuted at Peters’ house on last Wednesday while she was charging her mobile phone. The Lagos state police command spokesperson, Bala Elkana, says Peters and others who were present during the death of Kodak at his residence have been invited. He said “Yes it is true; he is in our custody answering some questions. We are investigating the circumstances that led to her death so definitely there are questions investigators will need to find out and he is one of those that need to answer some of those questions; that is why he has been invited and some few others who were there,” he said. The police officer also said they will be detained because of the seriousness of the case which borders on murder. “They are detained. It is a full-fledged investigation. It is a murder charge. We are probably looking at murder. We are not concluding at this stage. If she died of electrocution according to reports, it is left for us to find out. Was she actually electrocuted? What went wrong? An autopsy will also show” he added. According to reports, she suffered chest burns when the phone fell on her body and died before they got to the hospital.
