A guitar played in a memorable set by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain will be auctioned off in California, Julien’s Auctions announced in Beverly Hills on Monday. The Martin D-18E acoustic-electric guitar from 1959 will go under the hammer as part of the planned “Music Icons” auction on June 19 and 20. Cobain played the instrument during an “MTV Unplugged” appearance in New York in 1993. Rolling Stone magazine called the performance five months before the musician’s death his “last self-portrait,” according to Julien’s Auctions. The live album, released in 1994 with songs such as “About A Girl” and “Come As You Are,” won the Grammy in the category “Best Alternative Music.” The guitar will be auctioned with its original vintage black hardshell case, which has a purple interior.
