The Corporate Affairs Commission, (CAC), has told Nigerians that it is yet to start admitting customers and individuals into its premises for official business.This is in spite of the presidential order on the gradual easing of the lockdown directives earlier put in place occasioned by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic affecting the globe.Meanwhile, the CAC has said that arrangements are being made to ensure the safety of both staff and customers in line with the guidelines issued by the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19.According to information obtained from its official twitter handle, the CAC said that “Customers will be advised when such arrangements are concluded”.On Monday last week, President Muhammadu Buhari had announced that Nigeria will begin a “gradual easing” of coronavirus-related lockdowns particularly for Abuja (Federal Capital Territory), Lagos and Ogun states.However, Nigerians who have businesses to register urgently may have to wait for a later date due to unavailability of the Commission’s office premises for business.Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have so far being one of the major casualties of the harsh effects of Coronavirus as alot of uncertainties hover around survival of businesses in post Covid-19 era.
