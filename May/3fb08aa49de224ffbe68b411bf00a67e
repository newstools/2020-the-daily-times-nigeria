Garba Shehu, the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, has disclosed that his principal trusts women more than men. The Presidential Spokesperson disclosed this while making an appearance in an NTA programme on Friday May 29. When asked if President Buhari would appoint more women in his government, Shehu said; “This is a prayer you are making and I join you in prayer, I support you. I think he should get more women.” “In any case, do you know that all his ministers of finance have been women. “Let me say this, I hope I don’t get myself into trouble. He is more trusted of women than men, because he has given this country… all these years, all the country’s money is in the hands of women and they kept it safely. And they are doing well.” Garba Shehu also revealed that the President spends time with his grandchildren during his leisure, and usually takes a walk as a form of exercise. He added; “The president watches television, he watches wild life, he does watch NTA promptly as much as he can. “And the president enjoys being with little ones, he has a number of grand children and he is entertained by them all the time. “He takes a walk around the house and in a way, exercises himself.” There are only seven women among President Buhari’s 43 ministers.
