A Kenyan nurse quarantined after travelling from the capital, Nairobi, to Nakuru town in the Rift Valley region to visit her boyfriend under the pretext of going to offer essential services. The government has restricted travel in and out of Nairobi except for cargo trucks to curb the spread of coronavirus. Health workers are among essential service providers allowed to travel out of the capital and to operate past curfew hours. Neighbours alerted police of the nurse’s presence. Police visited the house in the company of health officials who said the nurse’s temperature was higher than normal and took her for 14-days mandatory quarantine.
