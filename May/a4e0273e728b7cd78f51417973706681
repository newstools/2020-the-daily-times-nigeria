A police station in Minnesota went up in flames late Thursday in a third day of demonstrations as the so-called Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seethed over the shocking police killing of a handcuffed black man. The station, which police had abandoned, burned after a group of protesters pushed through barriers around the building, breaking windows and chanting slogans. A much larger crowd demonstrated as the building went up in flames. The crowd was protesting the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, who died after Minneapolis police arrested him on Monday on suspicion of using a counterfeit banknote. Police handcuffed him and held him to the ground, with a bystander video showing an officer pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck. The videos showed Floyd saying that he couldn’t breathe until he went silent and limp. He was later declared dead. Hundreds of people had begun marching in Minneapolis in the late afternoon – many wear masks as protection against the novel coronavirus – while in St. Paul, just to the east, police said there was ongoing looting as multiple fires were reported.
