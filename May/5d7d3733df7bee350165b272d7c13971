With Serie A workout returning after the suspension of football due to COVID-19, Christian Ronaldo is set to resume training on Tuesday. His home island of Madeira hosted him for much of the past two months spent in lockdown, but he will be joining his teammates on Tuesday after completing his mandatory two-weeks in isolation. Practices at Juventus began on an individual level last week, with players strictly observing social distancing measures in this first step towards restarting activities in the nation. Like the rest of Europe, Italy’s top flight has been on hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic but with the country emerging from lockdown after in excess of 30,000 deaths, football’s return is now on the horizon. The league is now looking at June 13th as a provisional return date.
