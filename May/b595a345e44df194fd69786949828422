The South East Governors’ Forum has agreed to further engage the Nigerian Center for Disease Control (NCDC) to scale up testing for coronavirus. Chairman of the forum and Governor of Ebonyi state, Dave Umahi disclosed this yesterday at the end of the meeting of the forum held in Enugu. The governors also directed that all Igbos living outside Igboland should obey all extant COVID -19 orders, including the ban on inter-state movement among others. On community policing, the forum noted that the recent communication from the inspector general of police on community policing is not in tandem with the agreement reached by the governor’s with the police chief. “In the circumstance, we cannot begin its implementation until the programme reflects our earlier agreement. The south -east governors and their leaders request the inspector general or police to revert to our initial agreement reached on community policing at Enugu,” the forum stated. The forum also agreed that all state Houses of Assembly in the region should commence the process of enacting state security laws in line with the south -east joint security programme. The meeting also agreed to hold a visual meeting with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on linking the state capitals in the region to gas pipeline under the pipeline programme of the federal government. Present at the meeting were Enugu state Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Ebonyi state, Governor, Dave Umahi, Imo state Governor, Hope Uzodinma, Deputy Governors of Abia and Anambra states, Ude Okochukwu and Nkem Okeke respectively, and President General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Nnia Nwodo, among others.
