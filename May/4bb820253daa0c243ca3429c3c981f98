The 2021 Special Olympics GB National Summer Games schedule to take place in Liverpool from 4-7 August 2021 have been postponed due to coronavirus pandemic. The Games would have seen more than 2,000 athletes with learning disabilities compete in sports such as football, swimming and boccia. Special Olympics GB said given the “heightened risk” to those with intellectual disabilities, postponement was the “right decision”. A statement added: “We understand this is disappointing news for everyone involved, however the welfare of the athletes and volunteers continues to be our top priority and we must protect the health and wellbeing of all those involved in preparing for and hosting a major event.” Organisers will now work to reschedule the Games, which take place every four years.
