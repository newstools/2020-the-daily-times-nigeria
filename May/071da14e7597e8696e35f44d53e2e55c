Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State, on Friday, inaugurated a 15-man Community Policing Advisory Committee to check insecurity bedevilling some local government areas of the state. The governor said in Minna that the essence of the committee was to have a robust security system at the ward level. “I believe that security controlled at the ward level will have a great impact with regard to the general security of the state. “I am glad that this is happening now at a time we are faced with a lot of security challenges,” he said. Bello said that the appropriate place to combat crime was at the grassroots, saying that with a committee put in place, security situation at that level would improve. He alleged that the infiltration of bad eggs into the country’s security outfits was responsible for sabotage of operations against criminals.
