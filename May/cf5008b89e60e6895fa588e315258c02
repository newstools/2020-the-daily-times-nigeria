FC Seoul through a statement, expressed sincere remorse over the sex doll controversy, but insisted they used mannequins, not sex dolls, to mimic a home crowd during its 1-0 win over Gwangju FC at the Seoul World Cup stadium. With players competing in front of rows of empty seats, some football and baseball teams have been trying to create a festive and humorous atmosphere that involves filling stands with huge team banners, pictures of mask-wearing fans and even vegetables. FC Seoul said it was attempting to add an element of fun with the mannequins. The team said it was repeatedly reassured by Dalkom, the company that produced the mannequins, that they were not sexual products. But when providing its products for the stadium, Dalkom reused some of the mannequins it previously supplied to another company, FC Seoul said. The club’s statement did not directly address criticism of why it chose to work with Dalkom, which does manufacture sex dolls, according to the company’s website, or why nearly all the mannequins at the stadium were female in design.
