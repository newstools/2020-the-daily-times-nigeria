The FA Cup quarterfinals will now be played on the weekend of Saturday 11 July and Sunday 12 July with the final set for Saturday 1 August. This was announced on Friday, a day after the Premier League agreed to restart in mid-June following extensive consultations. The decision to re-start Premier League action gave the FA the chance to slot in the remaining matches as noted by Chief Executive officer, Mark Bullingham. “We are pleased to agree the provisional restart date for the 2019-20 Emirates FA Cup,” said Bullingham. “The competition has been an integral part of the English football calendar for nearly 150 years, and we’d like to thank the Premier League executive and clubs for their support in scheduling the remaining matches during this unprecedented time. “This has been a difficult period for many people and, while this is a positive step, the restart date is dependent on all safety measures being met. The health and wellbeing of players, staff, and supporters remain our priority.”
