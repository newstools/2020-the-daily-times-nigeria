See reactions of Nigerians on Twitter; Mr Femi Adesina said Nigerians are lucky to have Buhari at a time like this, but Google said we aren't lucky at all because Buhari has made Nigeria the headquarter for extreme poverty.Which country is the World headquarter for extreme poverty? Listen to the answer👇👇👇 pic.twitter.com/BWAyBA3HVx There's no problem being a buharist for eternity, but to say that the President is leading the country well is a clear case of someone speaking from his stomach… Mr Femi, it is insulting to say Nigerians are lucky to have a president that has been a complete failure and whose cardinal objective is the prosecution of northern hegemony. I give up on you! A day of reckoning awaits all of you working for Buhari and deceiving Nigerians You're definitely an ireedemably lost soul.
