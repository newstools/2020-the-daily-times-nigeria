The parents of Leah Sharibu, Nathan and Rebecca Sharibu, has lamented the continuous hostage of their daughter in the hands of Boko Haram who released 104 Dapchi girls but kept back Leah because of her resolved to remain a Christian. Leah’s parents who spoke through the Executive Director, LEAH Foundation, Dr. Gloria Puldu, on Thursday said their daughter will be spending her 17th birthday in the detention of Boko Haram, a tale too sad to tell, even when President Buhari has assured of her release to no avail, Puldu said.

According to her, “Today 14th May 2020, Leah clocks 17 years old. This is her 3rd birthday in captivity. She was taken into captivity when she was 14 years. “The federal government has not kept to their promise, even though it took Buhari eight months to finally speak to Leah’s parents and that was by a phone call. Buhari assured that he will do all he can to secure her release and that no effort would be spared to ensure her rescue, but the President’s promise has not been kept”, she said. LEAH FOUNDATION also known as Empowerment Advocacy & Humanitarian Foundation, in collaboration with IICON, has also done more work on Buhari’s wife Aisha, and the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, to prevail on the federal government to ensure Leah’s freedom. “Leah’s parents are going through a lot especially when they hear that their daughter has put to bed, or has been converted to Islam. “Since Leah’s abduction, no government official has reached out to her parent, only the Church, well meaning Nigerians and NGO’s”, Puldu said.Attachments area
