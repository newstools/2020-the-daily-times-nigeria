The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, has said the Madagascar COVID Organics has been received by his ministry. He said the formulation has been sent to the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development, and the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research for scientific evaluation. Confirming this development during the PTF briefing on Thursday in Abuja, Ehanire said, “The Madagascar herbs have been received at the Ministry of Health, and were found to consist of two varieties; one labelled to be for prevention and the other for treatment. Samples have been given to three agencies of the Ministry of Health and also to the Ministry of Science and Technology. “These are normal processes for new preparations to be approved for use in Nigeria and include toxicological and efficacy tests and clinical trials. The government will investigate all genuine efforts to find homegrown solutions to the pandemic.” Also, the minister said Nigeria would review its participation in the World Health Organisation solidarity trial. He also stated that proposals for the trial of local remedies for COVID-19 had been sent to the relevant research and testing agencies for scientific evaluation. President Muhammadu Buhari received the consignment of the formulation from his Guinea Bissau counterpart, Umaro Sissoco Embaló on May 16. It was later sent to the Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, two days after – May 18. The PTF chair had said he would hand over the five cartons to the minister of health who has the “responsibility of validation through his institutions chattered by law”.
