READ ALSO:  Kaduna quarantines 50 inter-state travel ban violators The Bill which was earlier passed into law early in the year was amended after observations were raised by the Executive through the office of the Attorney General of the State. The House however retained its position on the provision of Section 20 (1) which subjects the appointment of the Lagos State Amotekun Corps Commander to the confirmation of the House as it is in the practice and procedures of the House and because of the sensitivity of the position, despite the demands of the executive to the contrary. Also, given the fact that the Lagos Amotekun may carry arms, the House considered it necessary that appointment of Amotekun Corps Commander be properly scrutinised. However, the House agreed to uphold the observation of the Executive in the provisions of Section 20(3) of the bill, to the effect that the removal of the Lagos Amotekun Corps Commander does not necessarily require the concurrence of the House, giving the Governor the sole rights to determine the removal of the Corps Commander; and that there should be a single line of discipline in accordance with Public Service establishment and engagement. In respect of this, the Speaker, Rt. Hon. (Dr.) Mudashiru Obasa has directed Mr. Azeez Sanni, the Clerk of the House to forward a clean copy of the Bill to Mr. Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu for his assent. Lawmakers who moved the motion with Hon. Noheem Jimoh, are; Chief Whip Hon. (Mrs.) Mojisola Meranda, Deputy Chief Whip, Hon. (Mrs.) Mosunmola Sangodara, Hon. Tunde Braimoh, Hon. Lukmon Olumoh, Hon.
