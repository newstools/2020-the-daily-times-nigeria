Rotimi Amaechi  Nigeria’s transportation minister, has revealed that he didn’t join politics because he wanted to “solve Nigeria’s problems” but out of unemployment. Rotimi Amaechi disclosed during a recent interview with PUNCH that being a leader or wanting to solve Nigeria’s problems didn’t drive him into politics, rather his political journey started out of unemployment. “I didn’t join politics because I wanted to be a leader or because I wanted to solve Nigeria’s problems. I joined because of unemployment. I also believe there is a part that grace played in it,” the media quoted the minister as saying in an interview. Amaechi has been Nigeria’s minister of transportation since 2015. During the interview, Mr Amaechi also lamented the poor representation of the people by political officeholders, saying the poor have never been properly represented by the government whether it is the current administration, which he is part of, or the ones before it.
