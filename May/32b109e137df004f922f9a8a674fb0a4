He disclosed that about 60 per cent of the project’s cost had been paid by the Federal Government. The Minister charged the Management and Board of NIMASA to “go and complete the Deep Blue Project,” stressing that the success of NIMASA is, to a great extent, dependent on completion of the project. In his remarks, Chairman of the Board, Honourable Asita O. Asita, thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for the honour bestowed on them. Asita pledged to work harmoniously with the NIMASA Management to deliver the Agency’s mandate.
