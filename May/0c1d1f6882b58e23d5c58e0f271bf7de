English Championship side Fulham FC has confirmed that two of their players have tested positive for the coronavirus. In a statement on Thursday, Fulham said: “After the second round of league-wide testing for COVID-19 completed by Fulham FC players and staff this week at the Club’s training facility, we can confirm that two players have tested positive for Coronavirus.” The news came on the same day that Blackburn Rovers captain Elliott Bennett had confirmed that he had tested positive for the virus. Blackburn said that Bennett, 31, initially submitted a negative test on Friday, May 22 but then was positive when he underwent a second test on Monday. Bennett said: “I feel fit and healthy. I obviously would never have known if we hadn’t returned to training and taken the tests because I don’t feel unwell and have got no symptoms whatsoever.” The three are the only positive cases from the latest tests that involved 1,030 players and club staff overall. The news comes days after the EFL’s confirmed that there were two positive cases from the 1,014 tests done in the first two rounds with the two cases coming from Hull City.
