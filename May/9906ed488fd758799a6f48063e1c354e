Indian Nimisha Singh has gotten into trouble with her own tiktok #wipeitdownchallenge. Singh uploaded her own entry for the challenge video on her Instagram account only for her family and friends to realize that itâ€™s the first time in 12 years she has wiped the mirror. The mirror was filled with dust as she wiped through grooving to a popular song while wiping a mirror getting ready to transform to a different  version of herself.
