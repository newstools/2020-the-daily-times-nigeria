Hollywood may still be shaking off its awards-season hangover, but before it puts the tuxedos and gowns back in storage, Variety wants to take a look at some of the films that seem destined to dominate the next Oscars race. It’s true that on paper many movies that now appear earmarked for awards greatness may collapse on the shoals of audience indifference or fall prey to a good old-fashioned critical savaging. Why, this time last year, The Goldfinch, an adaptation of Donna Tartt’s beloved best-seller with Oscar winner Nicole Kidman and Ansel Elgort, looked like a certified best picture contender. Those dreams deflated when audiences actually saw the movie or, more to the point, chose not to see the movie.
