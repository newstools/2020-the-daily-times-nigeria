Reality TV Star, Kim Kardashian is celebrating her 6 years wedding anniversary to billionaire rapper, Kanye West. The couple have 4 kids together during their 6 years of marriage and are waxing stronger by the day. Although, there has been news of tension between the pair in the past, they have always managed to work things out to build the dynasty which they both now own. The KUWTK star also shared a couple of snapshots of her wedding day on her Instagram Stories with the same heartfelt caption. The Kar-Jenner clan matriarch Kris Jenner also took to her Instagram to wish the couple a happy anniversary, “Happy Anniversary to these two!!! I love you guys!!!!! ❤️❤️ @kimkardashian #KanyeWest.” As fans may recall, the two said “I Do” in a lavish wedding at the historic Forte di Belvedere in Florence, Italy. The couple was joined by their closest family and friends as well as their eldest daughter, North West. Since then, the two have proved time and time again that they’re head over heels for each other. In a 2013 interview for BBC, Kanye gushed about Kim giving him “everything.” He said, “Family time it’s what Kim gave me. She gave me everything. She gave me a family. She gave me a support system.” The two have gone on to welcome three more children to their family: Saint West, Chicago West and Psalm West. Ahead of popping the big question to Kim, Kanye gushed about his future bride to be. “I’m so happy to be with her, to live this life together, and with our relationship with God to be able to live forever in heaven together,” the 42-year-old 808’s & Heartbreak artist said. “ And also to raise a strong family that communicates truth and beauty, and we have a good time while doing it by just being creative…I love that fact that God has put her in my life—every single day.” READ ALSO Rep Ofumelu mourns late monarch of Ogbunike Congrats to Mr and Mrs West, we love them all.
