I have to get experience in the first team,” Okoye told Super Eagles media team in an Instagram chat. “I have discussed with Fortuna maybe I will go to the Dutch league on loan to play so that I can get premier league experience in the Netherlands. Okoye, who has one cap for the Super Eagles is delighted with his progress having started as a forward before switching to a goalkeeping role. “I started football at a young age but then I was a forward.
