Coronavirus has lead to most reality shows and movies delaying production, but the Kardashians are making it easier to keep up with their lives. The family decided to purchase new iPhones weekly to deliver KUWTK content to their fans while also ensuring the health and safety of all involved. According to Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ executive producer Farnaz Farjam, the family will be filming themselves rather than having the usual crew.
