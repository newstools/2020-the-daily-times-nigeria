The first of the ‘big leagues’ to return to action after suspension due to COVID-19, saw Dortmund playing  like there had been no break as they thrashed  Schalke 4-0. First-half goals from Erling Haaland and Raphael Guerreiro saw the home team head into the break leading, with the visitors having an underwhelming half. Thorgan Hazard scored the third goal of the match, and Guerreiro capped it off with his second of the day, as the Black Yellow moved within a point of Bayern at the top, with Bayern set to play tomorrow.
