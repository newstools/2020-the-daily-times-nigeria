Football Association has taken football’s governing body, FIFA, to court over Chelsea’s transfer ban. The FA seeks to battle FIFA over the accusation that they unprocedurally registered minors, which was one of the reasons the club was served with a ban. The case is now set to be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on June 26. The FA was in early 2019 found guilty of breaking certain rules pertaining to the registration of players and was given six months to address the registration of players, especially minors. Chelsea was found to have also broken certain guidelines in the signing of more than 60 young players under the age of 18. This led the governing body to slap the London club with a two-year transfer ban and fined £460,000. The club, however, appealed the decision, which saw both the ban and the fine reduced, allowing them (Chelsea) to sign players from January 2020.
