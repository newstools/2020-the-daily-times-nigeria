Mercy Eke had a lot to say about people who still believe that her relationship with Ike Onyema is simply a stunt. The reality TV star spoke about this during an Instagram sit-down, in which she talked, among other things, about their relationship, her concern for folks who don’t believe in them, and more. “People still doubt it because it is too real [and] because they don’t believe something they don’t know; they don’t believe our kind of relationship, love, whatever it may be,” she said.
