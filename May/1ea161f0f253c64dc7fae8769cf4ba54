Liverpool has confirmed Abdi Sharif contract extension with the Reds via their official website on Thursday. “It meant the world to me, signing a new extension,” the 19-year-old told Liverpoolfc.com. “I don’t think you get the opportunity to play for an amazing football club like Liverpool too often, so I was excited to sign. The staff that’s been around me throughout my injury, I can’t thank them enough, there’s so many to name.” “I just want to thank all of them for being there for me and I just can’t wait to get back at it and give everything that I have.” Sharif has been training with Liverpool since the age of six before joining the club officially three years later. The 19-year-old was a member of the FA Youth Cup-winning U18s side in 2019 and made his U23s debut in January of the same year. After signing his first professional contract he sustained a knee injury in pre-season and is currently completing his rehabilitation.
