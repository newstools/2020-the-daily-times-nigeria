Senator Shehu Sani has wondered why Nigeria seemed to be succeeding in the treatment of COVID-19 pandemic patients while others are failing and falling. Sani, a former member of the upper chamber of the National
Assembly, was reacting to revelations by discharged COVID-19 patients,
including High Chief Raymond Dokpesi, the founder of DAAR Communications,
owners of AIT and RayPower Radio stations in a tweet. Dokpesi had raised questions in a video circulated online
about the Nigerian COVID-19, asking when had COVID-19 become synonymous with
malaria. According to Dokpesi and his son, Raymond Dokpesi Jnr, who
was also confirmed positive for the virus and already discharged, they were
treated with malaria drugs. The senior Dokpesi also alluded to the fact that some of
those who were later declared COVID-19 positive had earlier been declared to be
having large dose of malaria parasites by some of the best laboratories in
Abuja. However, reacting to the revelations from the Dokpesi family
and other recovered patients, including the governor of Bauchi State and Dr.
Doyin Okupe, a former aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, who all said
they were treated with malaria drugs, Sani wondered why Nigeria seemed to be
succeeding in the use of these drugs to tackle the dreaded COVID-19 while other
nations were failing. “High Chief Raymond Dokpesi and many others who went into
Isolation revealed that they were treated with chloroquine, fully recovered and
discharged. “How come we are succeeding and countries with advanced
medical systems are failing and falling to the same virus? What is happening?”
he tweeted. Earlier in his series of tweets, the former lawmaker said:
“Treated and discharged, treated and discharged. Why are we really too scared
and panicky about what we can easily treat and discharge within days, if
actually what we are treating and discharging is the same thing that is scaring
us? “And why is the World not taking notice of us but
Madagascar?” He asked
