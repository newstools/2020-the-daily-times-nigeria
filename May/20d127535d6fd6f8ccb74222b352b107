For fast rising hip hop star, Michael Felix, his current hit single is one which came from a heartfelt disappointment. The single, ‘My money’, is currently making waves on music media and digital stores and fans are equally lauding the latest jam from the music act. The inspiration of the song, Felix revealed to R, was borne out of a relationship which painfully hit the rocks. He said his love for gospel music acts as young boy had given him the impression that he would be a gospel musician as he was inspired by Frank Edwards, but a twist of fate would soon happen when he fell in love. Speaking with R on how his heartbreak inspired his new song, he said “I had a girlfriend whom I loved deeply but was in it for my money. She started being promiscuous when things were a bit tight for me and it was the thought of whether I could ever accept her back that inspired my new jam.” Speaking on his style of music, the singer, who is being tipped by fans already to be the next hip hop superstar, disclosed that both gospel and hip hop songs have inspired his standout style of singing and is determined to growing in leaps and bounds. Since its release,the song has been making waves and doing the numbers on digital stores with Felix hinting that his fans should expect more from him
