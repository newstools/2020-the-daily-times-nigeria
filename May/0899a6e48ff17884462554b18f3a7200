The Defence headquarters says captured Boko Haram members are provided with face masks and also quarantined as a measure to curb the spread of COVID-19. The military recently launched a series of offensives against the insurgents, and while some fled, others were captured. According to the cable, John Enenche, coordinator defence media operations said this at a media briefing in Abuja. He said soldiers at the frontline are also provided with personal protective equipment (PPE), and that social distancing rule is observed by troops. “The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way everything will be done,” he said. “We have ordered for PPE for troops at the frontlines. “The moment they (Boko Haram members) are captured, they are quarantined and given face masks while observing social distancing too. “Captured or surrendered enemies are treated in line with the Geneva Convention. COVID-19 has changed the way things are done at the frontlines and in barracks.” In April, the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON), a parastatal under the ministry of defence, produced a ventilator known as DICOVENT and PPE to address the shortage of medical supplies in the country. Enenche had said in addition to its primary responsibility “to produce defence equipment, DICON has succeeded in diversifying its human, equipment, machinery as well as research and development capacity, to support a much-needed strategic intervention to cushion the effects of the highly dreaded COVID 19 in the country”.
