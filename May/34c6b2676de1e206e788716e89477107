With clubs returning to training this week as preparation for June resumption, english premier league fans have a reason to celebrate. Talks are ongoing to have the games broadcasted free-to-air as part of the plans dubbed ‘project restart’, and there might be another piece of good news. Britain’s culture secretary Oliver Dowden revealed on Wednesday that they have had the discussions of making it possible in a ‘win-win situation’, hinting at reaching an agreement. “That creates an opportunity for us to be able to get some sport, some Premier League free-to-air,” he said during daily routine updates on the COVID-19 pandemic. “Those discussions are ongoing, I’m having productive discussions a couple of weeks ago, now I had the latest one with Premier League, the EFL and with the FA. “I hope we can sort this out and I also hope then we can get some more money going into the sport of football. I think we could find ourselves in a win-win situation.” The matches are set to be played behind closed doors, and the planned free-to-air broadcasting will help reach a wider audience.
