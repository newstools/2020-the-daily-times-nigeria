The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has rescheduled the May 2020 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting that was earlier scheduled for Monday and Tuesday due to the public holidays announced by the federal government. CBN, in a statement by its Director of Communications, Mr. Isaac Okoroafor, said the meeting would now hold on Thursday, May 28.The postponement was as a result of the declaration of Monday and Tuesday, May 25 and 26, 2020 as Eid-el-Fitr holidays.The statement reads:“This is to inform our stakeholders and the general public that the May 2020 meeting of the MPC of the CBN, earlier scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, May 25 and 26, 2020 respectively, will now hold on Thursday, May 28, 2020. This is as a result of the declaration of Monday and Tuesday, May 25 and 26, 2020 as Eid-el-Fitr holidays. “For the avoidance of doubt, the CBN has put in place all necessary machinery for the meeting to now hold for only one day on account of the ongoing COVID-19 national lockdown and to align this meeting with extant rules of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 and advisories from other relevant agencies. All inconveniences caused by these changes are regretted.”
