The 2021 Africa Cup of Nations set to be held in Cameroon could be postponed to 2022 due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to reports. The upcoming tournament was set to take place between January 9th to February 6th but with four rounds of fixtures postponed, in addition to play-offs, and with eight months to the event, doubts have surrounded the staging of the tourney. A source within the African governing body reported that there is a possibility of holding the next year’s tournament in the summer of 2022. “There is almost no chance for the African Cup of Nations 2021 to be held next January,” Monte Carlo was quoted via egypttoday.com. “The intention is to postpone the competition to January 2022.” The source added that there was another option of postponing the AFCON tournament for a likelihood of 18 months to prevent clash with the 2022 World Cup. “It’s also possible to make it in the summer of 2022, because the World Cup will take place in November 2022. But we have to study this idea very well so as not to destabilize the African teams participating in the World Cup,” the source added. The previous tournament held in Egypt was the first AFCON to be played in the summer.
