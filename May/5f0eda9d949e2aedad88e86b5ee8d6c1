CAF President, Ahmad Ahmad, has confirmed the continent’s associations will earn US$200,000 grants as Covid-19 relief. This decision was reached by the CAF Emergency Committee to support Member Associations (MA). A total of USD 10.8 Million is expected to be distributed to 54 MA’s. ”Due to the fast-spread of COVID-19, African MA’s have suspended all domestic competitions, which has brought about huge financial burdens on their shoulders,” said President Ahmad’s statement via CAF’s website. To help mitigate the negative impact of #Covid19 on the finances of our members associations, @Caf_online’s #EMCO has taken the decision to immediately release  subventions worth $10.8m. https://t.co/VQqTrI5aBU
