Facebook has agreed to pay out 52 million dollars to content moderators who developed mental health problems on the job. The affected employees will get up to 50,000 dollars for treatment costs if they are diagnosed with a condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder, the plaintiffsâ€™ lawyers said Tuesday. Content checkers for the online network must regularly view images showing violence and abuse as part of their role. They are often employed through contractors rather than being directly hired by Facebook. In Autumn 2018, a former content moderator sued Facebook, alleging she had post-traumatic stress disorder after nine months of checking content. The agreement, which is still subject to approval by a judge, applies to more than 10,000 people from California, Texas, Arizona and Florida who have worked for Facebook since 2015. The minimum payment per moderator is 1,000 dollars.
