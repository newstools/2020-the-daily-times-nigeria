Ilorin – A Muslim cleric, Abdulmumeen Hanafi, on Tuesday in Ilorin advised Muslims to desist from begging as a means of livelihood. Hanafi, who gave the advice in his Ramadan lecture entitled, “Begging in Islam,” said there were various sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad which warned against begging for a living. The cleric, who is also a lecturer at the College of Arabic and Islamic Studies (CAILS) in Ilorin, lamented the rate at which people now indulge in begging for a living. He, however, warned Muslims not to reproach beggars if they approach them for alms. “Either donate something or speak what is good or politely excuse yourself,” he said. Emir of Ilorin hails Gambari’s appointment as Buhari’s new Chief of Staff Hanafi also urged well-to-do individuals in the society to assist indigent persons to engage in lucrative ventures as a means of livelihood so that poverty would reduce. The cleric further urged Muslims to arm themselves with education, saying night Quranic classes had now become unfashionable. He said many now engage in watching football matches in the night instead of attending Quranic classes. (NAN)
