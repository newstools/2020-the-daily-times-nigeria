In a press release signed by the Coordinator, Centre for Information and Public Relation, Ademola Adekoya, the Vice Chancellor noted that an appointment into such an exalted position is not a mean feat, but a testament of their hard work, sacrifice and dedication to the noble profession – Law, and an exemplary contribution to the Lagos State and FCT Judiciaries. The Vice Chancellor is however not surprised by the elevation, as their burgeoning legal career is rooted in a foundation of excellence provided by the LASU Law Faculty, from where they graduated at different times. Prof. Fagbohun, who is also a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, further urged their Lordships to continue on the path of integrity and honour as they discharge the responsibilities of their new assignments with the courage, resilience and fear of God, while praying for God’s wisdom and protection for them.
