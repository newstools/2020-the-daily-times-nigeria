Hundreds have joined demonstrations in the German cities of Stuttgart and Berlin to protest the ongoing restrictions on public life sparked by the coronavirus. Organisers say several thousand people joined what they described as a “non-partisan” weekly protest in the southwest city of Stuttgart on Saturday (local time). Protest initiator Michael Ballweg claimed 5000 people joined the demonstration, up from a few hundred the week before. Stuttgart police would not estimate the size of the crowd, but said the gathering went off without incident and that demonstrators largely kept the required distance from one another.
