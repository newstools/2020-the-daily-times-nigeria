Despite losing an estimated $38 billion as part of his recent divorce, the Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ colossal wealth is growing at such a rate that Bezos could become inaugural member of the 13-figure club by 2026, at an age of 62, says a new study by Comparisun. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is still by far the world’s richest person and his net worth has grown by 34 per cent on average over the last five years, said the study by Comparisun, a company which helps organisations compare different business products. Others also mentioned include, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg could gain trillionaire status almost a decade later than Bezos. But Zuckerberg’s current rate growth would see him worth $1 trillion, when he will be just 51 years old, said the study. India’s Mukesh Ambani could become a trillionaire in 2033 when he will be aged 75, according to the research which said that Chinese real estate tycoon Xu Jiayin will follow Bezos to become the second trillionaire in the world in 2027. Alibaba’s Jack Ma could become a trillionaire in 2030 when he will be aged 65. Of the 25 individuals the company analysed, only eleven realistically have a chance of becoming a trillionaire during their lifetime, based on their recent rate of wealth growth. Comparisun analysed the market capitalization of the 25 highest valued companies on the New York Stock Exchange according to Macrotrends, as well as the net worth of the richest 25 people in the world, according to Forbes, in both cases taking the last five years of data. For both the studies about companies and CEOs, Comparisun calculated the average yearly % growth over the last five years and applied this rate of growth for each future year to try and predict how the value will change.
