NBA’s legendary player and Georgetown University coach, Patrick  Ewing has tested positive for the new coronavirus. “I want to share that I have tested positive for COVID-19. This virus is serious and should not be taken lightly. I want to encourage everyone to stay safe and take care of yourselves and your loved ones,” Ewing, 57, said on Twitter early Saturday. Ewing was a New York Knicks star, playing for the franchise for 15 seasons (1985-2000). Before the 1985 NBA draft, Ewing had played for Georgetown while in college and started coach the team since 2017. The Knicks’ ex-center appeared in the NBA All-Star for 11 times. In 2003, the Eastern Conference team retired Ewing’s no. 33 jersey to honor their veteran. After a 15-year-spell at the Knicks, Ewing joined the Seattle SuperSonics in 2000, then ended his NBA career at the Orlando Magic once the 2001-2002 season finished. During his 17-season NBA career, Ewing averaged 21 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. Separately Ewing was a two-time gold medalist with the US national team in the Olympic Games, 1984 Los Angeles and 1992 Barcelona.
