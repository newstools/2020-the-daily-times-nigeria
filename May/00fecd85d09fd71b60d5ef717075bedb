One Chukwudi Maduka, a 50-year-old man has allegedly committed suicide in his home at Umuezu-Ore Umuana village Uhuahia North Local Government Area of Abia state. The Public Relations Officer of the Abia State Police Command, SP. Geoffrey Ogbonna, disclosed this in an interview with journalists in Umuahia on Tuesday. Ogbonna said that the deceased was found dead early on Monday in his one-room apartment. He further explained that the man did not leave suicide note, adding that the command had commenced investigation into the incident to unravel the reason for the suicide. However, a resident of the area, Dave Maduakor, while speaking with journalists said the deceased set his apartment on fire before hanging himself, on the ceiling fan in the room. Maduakor said that neighbours sensed danger when they noticed smoke coming out from his room. He said, “When they tried to open the door, they noticed that it was locked from inside so they forcefully opened it and found Maduka’s body hanging in the fan.” He also explained that the deceased was reported to have traveled to his village in Lokpanta in the Umunneochi Local Government Area of Abia and returned to Umuana community on Friday. According to him, the Chairman of the community, Mr Ngozi Onwumere, together with the landlord, had consulted a group, known as “kamanu” to help bring down the body of the man, which was later deposited in a mortuary. The deceased worked as a security man at the National Root Crops Research Institute in Umudike, Umuahia. READ ALSO I know what you must be feeling, Buhari condoles Sheik Ahmed Lemu.
