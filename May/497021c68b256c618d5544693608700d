The  Secretary to  Government of the Federation Mr. Boss Mustapha has said that President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the presidential task force on COVID-19 to  get  Madagascar’s self-proclaimed, plant-based “remedy” for coronavirus,  Covid-Organics. He said that the president  gave clear instruction that the herbs be subjected to checks by relevant authorities in Nigeria. Mustapha  said that: “The president of Madagascar sent it to Guinea Bissau. Certain allocations have been made to different countries. We have an indication of the quantities that have been allocated to Nigeria, and we are supposed to make arrangements to freight it out of Bissau to Nigeria,” “The president of Madagascar sent it to Guinea Bissau. Certain allocations have been made to different countries. We have an indication of the quantities that have been allocated to Nigeria, and we are supposed to make arrangements to freight it out of Bissau to Nigeria,” he said. “I have received instructions from Mr President to make arrangements to freight it home.” The “remedy” is a drink derived from artemisia, a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment, and other indigenous herbs. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned against adopting the product which has not been “taken through tests to see its efficacy”. “We are concerned that touting this product as a preventive measure might then make people feel safe,” Matshidiso Moeti, WHO’s head in Africa, had said.
