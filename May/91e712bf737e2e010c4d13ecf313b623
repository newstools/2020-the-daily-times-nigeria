Born Adebukonla Kukoyi, November has been a singer her entire life. Not to sound cheesy but she is the typical church girl – joined the choir at age 10, has always been in the choir,  still is in the choir and isn’t planning on leaving anytime soon. She creates music that will appeal to ‘Core Christians’ and the general public as a whole. After all, Jesus didn’t come for the saved but the unsaved. November or BukkyNovember as she is known on social media is a gospel music artiste based in Lagos, Nigeria. Her name alone strikes a conversation. It is quite unusual for one to bear the name November but there is really little mystery as to why. She was born in the month of November the 28th and as far as pet names go, this became one. November is also a saxophonist gradually creating a niche for herself in the jazz genre.  She recently released her official debut single titled ‘Don’t Pass Me By’ which is available on popular music stores online. In the not-so-distant future, November hopes to become a household name inspiring people across the world to live their best lives, trust God freely and be who they truly were created to be.
