40-year-old comedian and Hollywood actor Kevin Hart has explained why his wife Eniko Parrish stayed with him after having extramarital affairs. According to Hart, she decided to grant him a second chance but set down some conditions for him to live by. During a conversation on The School of Greatness podcast, he said: “She came to an amazing conclusion of, ‘I like the fact that we have a family, that we have a household, and I like the fact that we now got a job to do to get better’. “‘That’s what you owe me. You owe me the get-better.’ And she held me accountable. It wasn’t a walk in the park, but it was her understanding that we don’t let the outside world affect our inside, and I credit her for setting that tone.” Hart applauded his wife, Eniko by referring to her as “the strongest person in the world.” Hart’s affair with model Montia Sabbag during a trip to Las Vegas in 2017 was caught on tape and later released in an attempt to blackmail the comedian. In September 2019, Sabbag filed a lawsuit against Hart for $60 million on grounds that the star and his friend JT Jackson set her up by concealing a camera to record the sexual encounter.
