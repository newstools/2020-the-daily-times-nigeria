AS the September governorship elections in Edo State continue to gather momentum, the re-election bid of Governor Godwin Obaseki of the All Progressives Congress (APC) may have received a boost as members of the legislative arm of Oredo Local Government Council of Edo State on Sunday declared their support for the “focused and performing” governor. The lawmakers also passed a vote of confidence on the
leadership of the council’s Chairman, Jenkins Osunde, whom they said was
determined to transform the ocal government area. The councillors spoke in Benin, when they paid a solidarity
visit to Osunde. The twelve members of the council’s legislative arm, through
their leader, Ewansiha Jeffery, expressed optimism that Obaseki would emerge
victorious during next month’s primaries of APC and he would also win the
September 19 election. They hailed the council chairman for complementing the
efforts of the Edo governor in the LGA. The councillors said: “We will not allow mischief makers to
cause crisis in Oredo LGA of Edo State. The council Chairman is on the same
page with Governor Obaseki for his second term bid.” The members of the legislative arm of Oredo local government
council also assured that the vision of Osunde would not be derailed by enemies
of democracy.
