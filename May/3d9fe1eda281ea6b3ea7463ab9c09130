Osun State Government on Friday said it had successfully managed a coronavirus patient said to be an 82-year-old hypertensive widow. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr Rafiu Isamotu, who disclosed this in a statement, said, “The story of the 82-year-old widow who recovered from the dreaded coronavirus provides a glimmer of hope, considering that she is a hypertensive patient on medication. “Although when she arrived at our isolation centre on the 13th of May, she had no cough, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, fever or anosmia associated with the virus except for diarrhoea and we successfully treated her for it and she was stable all through the period of hospitalisation. “On her 9th day on admission, we carried out a follow-up Polymerase chain reaction test on her and the result came back negative and she was subsequently discharged on the 24th of May, 2020. Furthermore, a follow-up at her home after her discharge revealed that she was stable.”
