Commenting on the development, Rwanda’s Minister of Information, Communication Technology and Innovation, Paula Ingabire, said, “The infectious nature of COVIDー19 calls for technological innovations to tackle the pandemic. This is why Rwanda has introduced robots, drones among high-tech initiatives to enhance efficiency in the fight.” Also, RBC Director-General, Sabin Nsanzimana, said, “There is no better cause than investing in health. These robots will reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19 among health workers and facilitate the transition from paper-based patient files to digital records at the Rwanda Ministry of Health.”
