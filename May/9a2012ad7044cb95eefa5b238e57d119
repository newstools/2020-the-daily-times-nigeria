Leading business has accused the youngest Kardashian family member, Kylie Jenner over the value of her cosmetics company. Forbes magazine said, the youngest half-sister of Kim Kardashian West, is spinning a “web of lies” to inflate the size and success of her business. 22-year-old Jenner has responded to Forbes via tweets. i can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money i have “What am I even waking up to,” she tweeted. “I thought this was a reputable site.. all I see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. I’ve never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. period. “‘Even creating tax returns that were likely forged’ that’s your proof? So you just THOUGHT they were forged? Like actually what am I reading.” However, in later tweets Jenner was more philosophical and said she did not want to obsess over her wealth. “I am blessed beyond my years, I have a beautiful daughter, and a successful business and i’m doing perfectly fine,” she said. “I can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money I have.” Jenner agreed to sell a 51% stake of her cosmetics company, which includes the brands Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin, to the publicly traded beauty firm Coty for £486m ($600m) in November in a deal valuing her business at about £970m.
