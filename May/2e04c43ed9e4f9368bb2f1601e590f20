Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has motivated the state’s judges with car gifts worth N22m. The Executive Council of Imo State commended Gov. Uzodinma during the State Executive Council (EXCO) meeting on Wednesday. The Nation reports that the members said  Uzodinma demonstrated the humanity in him and willingness to provide leadership. The EXCO, therefore, gave their nod to the purchase and donation of 23 Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) for the judges and another one for the newly elected Deputy Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly. Briefing newsmen on the outcome of the meeting, the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba reiterated that the purpose of the car gifts was to basically motivate the judges and facilitate their job. The commissioner said what was instructive was the ingenuity of Governor Uzodinma to source funds for the purchase of the vehicles from Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) base of the State. Emelumba further informed that the vehicles were procured at the cost of N22million per vehicle as against the budgeted N37million per vehicle by the sacked government, and as such saved nearly ₦500 million from the cost of the 23 vehicles, adding that the Governor saved the state from unnecessary and frivolous financial waste. According to him, the Council also discovered with dismay that some Permanent Secretaries have not put the official vehicles given to them by the State Government for day to day running of their official duties to use, hence portraying the State in bad light and denying the magnanimity of the present administration to civil servants.
