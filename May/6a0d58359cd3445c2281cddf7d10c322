He added that Ecobank had invested in a robust technology-based model which positioned it to cope with current and future challenges including the provision of convenient digital banking services to customers in a seamless manner across 36 countries on the African continent. CIBN Registrar/Chief Executive, Seye Awojobi, said the initiative of the bank to host the event digitally is pacesetting for the industry. He commended the bank for the high premium placed on training and building the competencies of its workforce. “The CIBN is quite impressed with the importance Ecobank attaches to the training of new hires and capacity building of its staff. I have lost count of how many graduation events I attended at the state of the art Ecobank Academy last year. This is certainly the way to grow the bank and the industry to meet up with global standards. “I advise the graduands to display a high level of integrity. One of the truest tests of integrity is its blunt refusal to be compromised. You should be ready to give your best to the bank that hired and trained you and thereby contributing your quota to the growth of the industry.” Speaking further, the Managing Director, Ecobank Nigeria, Patrick Akinwuntan encouraged the graduands to remain ethical and diligent in the delivery of the vision of the bank to become the most preferred financial services payments brand in Nigeria to support the economic development of households and growth of trade, manufacturing and commerce in Nigeria and Africa. Welcoming the graduands formally to the bank, Acting Head, Human Resources, Ecobank Nigeria, Kunle Adewuyi said the bank offers an enabling and conducive environment for staff to excel to the highest level, adding that its reward system remains a motivating factor for high performance and productivity. He explained that the Ecobank Graduate Trainee program is an intensive one year of in-depth training for fresh graduates, aimed at equipping the participants who maybe coming from non-financial and banking related academic backgrounds with the necessary skillset and knowledge required to work in the banking and finance industry.
