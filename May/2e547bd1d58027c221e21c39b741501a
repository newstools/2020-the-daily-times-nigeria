AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq to name a stand at the Main Bowl of the Kwara Stadium Complex after the late goal merchant. It further suggested that a football competition could be named and sponsored in honour of the Yekini to memorialise him. SWAN also urged the state government and good spirited individuals to support Yekini’s aged mother, Alhaja Sikiratu Yekini, who currently resides in Ijagbo, near Offa in Kwara. “No doubt, Yekini put the name of the state on the world map during his playing days with the Super Eagles and the Vitoria Setubal of Portugal,” it said. According to SWAN, the Ira born football star who died on May 4, 2012 after retiring from active football, deserved being honoured. It would be recalled that Yekini who scored Nigeria’s first ever World Cup goal, played 58 times and scored 37 goals for the Super Eagles.
