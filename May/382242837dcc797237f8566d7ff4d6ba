The BVB star is eager to get back onto the park and is targeting Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga. Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus has said that he does not feel that he is part of an experiment as the Bundesliga prepares for its grand return on Saturday. The coronavirus pandemic has seen the game stopped around much of the world for the last two months, but having navigated the crisis more effectively than many of its European neighbours, Germany, which has seen over 8,000 deaths, is preparing to open its doors to professional sport once more. Reus says that he feels good to be heading back onto the field but has warned that caution must still be exercised in the circumstances, with more than 175,000 people in the country having tested positive for the virus.
