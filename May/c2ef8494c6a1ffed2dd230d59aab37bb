The Chairman of the All Progressive Congress APC in Cross River State, Sir John Ochalla has put a lie to the claim by one Ekpenyong Effiom Asuquo, that the state governor, Ben Ayade has been funding the APC in the state. Ochalla in a press statement made available to newsmen on
Monday said that he would have ordinarily ignored the write up from Ekpenyong
Effiom Asuquo, who is the secretary to a youth forum in state chapter of the
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), but that “the times we are in now politically
are very interesting and I will not let this opportunity pass by without
keeping the records straight.” He said that the controversial statement from the Youth Forum of the PDP, in paragraph seven, stated that “Ayade has been funding the APC ever since. This statement is not only a tissue of lies but a figment of the author’s imagination.” COVID-19: Oyo begins fresh awareness campaign in major markets His words, “to the best of my knowledge, Governor Ayade has
not funded the APC with a kobo at any level, rather the PDP and Governor Ayade
tried and are still trying to sow seeds of discord within the APC, but thank
God majority of our people are wise enough to see through their antics.” “The PDP should not drag the APC into their internal crisis.
Let the PDP dance her strip dance in shame. All their evil plans against the
APC have boomeranged. “The APC Cross River State is re-engineering with absolute
resolve to key Cross River State into the progressive family and save our people
from a confused, clueless, and visionless PDP administration in the state. “I advise the PDP government in Cross River to focus their
energies on educating our people on how to contain the Covid-19 pandemic and
provide palliative to Cross Riverians in these difficult times. “Our doors remain open to all those who are ready to jump
out of the PDP sinking ship into the progressive APC family,” Ochalla said.
