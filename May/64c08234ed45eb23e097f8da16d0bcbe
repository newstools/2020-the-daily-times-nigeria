The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Plateau State, on Thursday observed a low key passing out parade for its 2019 batch “B” stream 1 corps members. The modest occasion was as a result of the dreaded virus ravaging the entire globe, forcing a new way of life style in the bid to keep citizens safe from contacting the scourge. Complying with what is gradually becoming a new normal, the Plateau NYSC, discharged a total of 2,027 corps members, presenting them with their certificates with strict adherence to the social distance rules. Speaking at the occasion, the NYSC State boss, Mrs. Caroline Embu, said the corps members will not forget in a hurry the unusual way in which the passing out parade was conducted. Tagging it “COVID-19, POP”, Embu charged the outgoing corps members to be disciplined at all times, adding that only those with firm principles will survive the challenges ahead. “It’s a pity you are passing out this way, but thank God you are all alive and well. Respect your parents and continue to listen to advise. Be disciplined because you are going into a competitive world”, Embu said.
