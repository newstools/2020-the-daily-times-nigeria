Controversial Nigerian investigative journalist, Kemi Olunloyo has in a recent tweet on her Twitter page said ladies who hail from the South Eastern part of the country are the least educated females in the country. According to Madam Kemi, the reason for this is because Igbo female icons don’t empower their kind enough and as such, they’re still fazed with the housegirl and street prostitute mentality. She says female icons who hail from their ethnicity, forget the girls in the village, however, ladies like controversial blogger, Blessing Okoro who was caught flaunting another man’s house as hers a while back are changing the narrative. She wrote on her page, Igbo girls are the least educated in Nigeria. The house girl and street prostitute mentality is still there.
