Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau state on Monday in Jos, decried the flouting of the 6pm to 7am curfew by desperate travelers coming into the state. The governor, while monitoring some major borders in the state, said that the Plateau-Bauchi border and Plateau-Kaduna forest borders were notorious for the anomaly. Lalong said that unchecked travelers through the borders was the major channel for the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) into the state. He said that the 17 COVID-19 cases so far recorded in Plateau state were mostly from persons who came in from Kano and Lagos states. He warned security agencies against laxity in their duties as they have been directed to stop vehicles not on essential duties from entering the state. “I have said vehicles not on essential duties should not be allowed to enter the state as from 6pm. “They should sleep at the point of arrest until 7am the next day to allow for thorough checks and medical examination of the occupants,” he said. He said that through the Close Circuit Television (CCTVs) installed at the borders, he observed that trucks were still entering the state by 1am and 2am, especially at the Plateau-Bauchi border and Plateau-Kaduna forest borders. Lalong said the visit was also to encourage enforcement officers at the borders to discharge their duties diligently and to know their challenges while on duty. He said the state and community leaders had agreed to block all illegal routes in their domain, adding that defaulters would be turned back to where they came from. The governor also visited the Vom-Manchok border, Jengre-Saminaka and Bauchi-Plateau borders, as well as the mobile court at Jengre in Bassa Local Government Area, where 138 defaulters had been convicted since it was established on April 9.
