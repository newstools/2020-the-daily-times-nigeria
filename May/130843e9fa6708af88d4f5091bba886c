5 persons linked to the death of a 25-year-old man, Monsur Kareem, have been arrested by the Ogun state Police. The suspects identified as Toheeb Popoola, Ibrahim Ridwan, Mutiu Tijani, Akeem Ishola and Lawal Afeez were arrested for reportedly beating Kareem to death. Ogun state police spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi said the suspects were arrested after the father of the deceased Najeem Kareem, filed a complaint at Sango Police Station. Najeem said his son was beaten to death while trying to broker peace between a tricycle rider and Popoola following a heated argument they had. Oyeyemi said in a statement; “Preliminary investigation revealed that while a landlord in the area was coming in his tricycle loaded with kegs of water, he fell down with the kegs of water and while picking the kegs, Toheeb Popoola, whose house is situated in the place, came out to question him for staying there. “This led to an argument between them and it was at that point that the deceased met them and tried to intervene. “His intervention did not go down well with Toheeb, who invited the other four suspects to the scene, and ordered them to beat both the deceased and the tricycle rider. “In the process, the deceased was rushed to hospital, where he was confirmed dead. “The corpse of the deceased has been deposited in the Ifo General Hospital’s mortuary for autopsy.” The state’s Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for discreet investigation and diligent prosecution.
