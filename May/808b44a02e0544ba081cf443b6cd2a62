9. A man was on Wednesday crushed to death by a Honda Odyssey car, marked AAA 589 FV, around Adedero village along Abeokuta -Sagamu expressway in Ogun State. Mr. Babatunde Akinbiyi, the Public Relations Officer, Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), confirmed the incident to newsmen in Abeokuta. Akinbiyi noted that the accident occurred around 11a.m. He explained that the dead male victim, according to eye witness, was on video call while crossing the road and got knocked down by the Honda car. ”We learnt a commercial Mazda car in which the deceased was driving in was on its way to Ajah in Lagos from Kuto park in Abeokuta , when the driver noticed it had ran out of fuel. “The driver had to park off the road to go and purchase fuel while the passengers in the vehicle waited for his arrival. “Since there is a road diversion along the Abeokuta-Siun-Sagamu Interchange, due to ongoing reconstruction, the deceased decided to cross to the other side of the road for safety. “However, when the driver of the Mazda came back and had refilled the vehicle, the deceased, while crossing back, was making a video call, oblivious of the fact that a vehicle was coming from the Sagamu end to Abeokuta. “The vehicle, which was the Honda Odyssey, hit him and he died on the spot,” he said. Akinbiyi explained that the man’s corpse had been deposited at the morgue of General Hospital, Ijaiye, Abeokuta.
