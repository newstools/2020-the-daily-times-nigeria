Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng says he can imagine staying with the Bundesliga club beyond his current contract now that coach Hansi Flick is staying. “My contract in Munich runs until 2021. Under coach Hansi Flick, I can imagine fulfilling it,” the 31-year-old told the German sport tabloid Sport Bild for its Wednesday edition. Flick took over in Munich in November on a temporary basis after Niko Kovac was dismissed, but a string of impressive performances earned him the job long-term and a contract signed late last month. Boateng has had an at-times turbulent relationship with the Munich leadership, and he had appeared keen to move to another club.

Flick was the German national team’s assistant coach for the 2014 World Cup, where Germany took the title. Boateng was part of that winning team. (dpa)
