A Nigerian lady identified as @dazzlingvi on Twitter has taken to the platform to express her pain after losing both parents and 6 siblings within the space of 2 years. Narrating her sad ordeal, Vee said she doesn’t know what she ever did to deserve such punishment from God. Vee said her dad’s death is the most painful of all, because they were really close. She also spoke about the death of her 6 siblings, and ended it up with an emotional question “How does one recover from this sort of pain?” Even if I’m the worst sinner in the world, I don’t think I deserve this sort of punishment from God. Six siblings gone, both parents gone in space of 2years how does one recover from this sort of pain? I feel like my heart is literally being ripped apart. I’m alone in the world. Weigh consequences lifting lockdown, PTF tells states It’s was my Dad that taught me how to use sanitary Pad, he was the one that gave me the sex talk don’t let boys come close to you and so on, it hurts so bad that I wasn’t able to do all I wanted to do for him before God took him from me.
