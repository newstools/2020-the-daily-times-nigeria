No wonder he was fondly called Ezedioranma 1. “Having lived an exemplary life in service to God, the nation and humanity in his earthly sojourn, it is our belief that he has handed over to the living as he goes to rest with his creator. On behalf of the good people of Oyi/Ayamelum Federal Constituency of Anambra State, I urge you all to remain steadfast in your prayers and be assured that as we bid him farewell, you are close to our thoughts and prayers as always. “May the Good Lord grant his soul eternal rest in His bosom and comfort, to all of us as we surely miss him.”
