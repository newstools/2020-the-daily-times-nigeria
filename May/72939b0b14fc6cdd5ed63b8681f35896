Premier League side Arsenal has confirmed Sir Chips Keswick has retired from his position as Arsenal chairman. Chips who has been in Arsenal’s board since 2005, was appointed as the club’s chairman seven years ago when Arsene Wenger was still the head coach of the Gunners. Chips is set to leave this summer, the north London club has decided not to appoint his successor with the board now comprising of Stan Kroenke, Josh Kroenke, Lord Harris, and Ken Friar. “It has been an honour to be the chairman of this great football club,” he told the club’s official website. “Arsenal has always held a special place in my life and that will remain the case in the future. I made my plan to retire at the end of this season clear to the board, before the global health crisis we are now experiencing.” “The club is in safe hands with Stan and Josh, the board and the executive team. I know Arsenal will emerge stronger from this situation and I look forward, like all our supporters around the world, to seeing the team in action as soon as possible.”
