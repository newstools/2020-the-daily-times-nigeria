China will launch in June the last satellite for Beidou-3 Navigation Satellite System, an array of 30 satellites that will provide services to global users, an official said. Ran Chengqi, director of the China Satellite Navigation Office said the Beidou-3 Navigation Satellite System will consist of 30 satellites, and 29 satellites are now in orbit. The last satellite is expected to complete the network after its launch in June, according to CCTV.com. “The satellite and rocket have been moved to the launch site, and we are making all preparations before launch, which is expected to be implemented as planned,” he said. The last satellite of the Beidou-3 satellites is to be launched is a geostationary orbit. Prior to this, China’s Beidou-1 and Beidou-2 system provided services to the world. “After the launch of the last satellite, we will later announce the completion of the global system and provide all Beidou services, such as high-precision services,” Ran added. China’s BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) is one of the four space-based GNSSs in the world, which includes the US’ GPS, Russia’s GLONASS, and the European Union’s Galileo. The BDS system started to provide global service at the end of 2018, as the construction of the BDS-3 primary system had been completed by then.
