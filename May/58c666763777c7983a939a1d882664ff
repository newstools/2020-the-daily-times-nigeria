Governor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State has restated his administration’s commitment to continue to prioritise children’s well-being and sound education for their brighter future as the world commemorates the 2020 Children’s Day. The governor, in a statement in Gombe on Wednesday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr. Ismaila Uba-Misilli, described children as the hope of the state and the nation. Yahaya said to build a better tomorrow, “we must build our children,’’ describing children as future leaders, who required absolute care, security and right upbringing from both parents and government. “Education is the best weapon of preparing children for leadership and resultant peaceful and prosperous society; therefore, I wish to reiterate our total commitment to their welfare. “My administration will continue to strengthen measures that will revamp the education sector in the state by ensuring those out-of-school children and those of school age; especially girls enjoy basic and sound education,” he said. The governor said this year’s theme: “Promoting Girl-Child Education for Sustainable Future” was apt and timely, considering the importance and place of the girl-child in the attainment of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While advising children to remain focused and resolute for the future, Yahaya said it was imperative for parents, teachers, community leaders and all stakeholders to be involved in mentoring and providing good leadership to them. The governor noted that due to the lockdown and restriction orders as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, children’s education had suffered some setbacks nationally and internationally. He, however, expressed optimism that with adequate measures and strategies in place, children would regain the lost grounds and emerge stronger with renewed vigour in academic pursuit.
