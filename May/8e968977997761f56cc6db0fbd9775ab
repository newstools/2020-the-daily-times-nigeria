Chairman of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Edo state chapter, Vincent Okoawo on Friday, said the party will leverage on the political crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to win the forthcoming governorship election in the state. He gave the assurance at the party’s secretariat in Benin during a meeting with party stakeholders from the 18 local government areas of the state. Okoawo said with the internal crisis within the APC, it will be an opportunity for the ADC to wrestle power from them because a house that is divided against itself cannot stand. “APC is in disarray, you can see they have various groups which include EPM, GGO among others. “A house divided against itself cannot stand and wrestle power with us. ADC is one party “APC do not have the unity and at the end of the day, they may not field a candidate because of the factions in the party. “Look at PDP, they had issues in their congress and they have not been able to resolve their issues. “They are even afraid of us and not the other way round because we have unity and unity is power. “We have security of purpose, the financial muscle, intellectual capacity and everything we need to displace opposition parties, and win the election. “More so, our aspirants possess impeccable characters,” he said. Former state Chairman of the party, Mr. Friday Musa, said the party is going to adhere strictly to its constitution in determining who becomes its governorship candidate.
