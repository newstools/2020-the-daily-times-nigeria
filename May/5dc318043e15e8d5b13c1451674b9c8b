Chelsea have decided to keep Olivier Giroud at Stamford Bridge until the end of the 2020-21 season, after extending the striker’s contract. The French striker who spent five-and-a-half seasons at Arsenal before joining Chelsea in January 2018 said; “I am delighted to continue my journey and adventure at Chelsea,” Giroud told the club’s website. “I can’t wait to get back to playing and enjoying competitive football with my team-mates. I’m looking forward to wearing the Chelsea shirt again, especially in front of our fans at a full Stamford Bridge, whenever it is safe to do so.” Giroud has gone on to score 21 goals in 76 appearances for the west London club.
