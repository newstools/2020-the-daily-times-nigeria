A new video shared online appears to show three Minneapolis Police Department officers kneeling on George Floyd during his arrest on Monday, which later led to his death. Recall, a previous video posted by eyewitness Darnella Frazier showed Floyd, 46, being knelt on by one officer, Derek Chauvin, who has now been arrested and charged with George Floyd’s murder. In this new video, which was captured from the other side of the Minneapolis police vehicle where the arrest occurred, Chauvin and two other white officers were filmed kneeling on Floyd. Chauvin was taken into custody on Friday afternoon, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety. He faces charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. The three other officers were fired in connection to Floyd’s death, but they are yet to be arrested or charged. See video;
