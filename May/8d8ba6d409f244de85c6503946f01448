Some Nigerians have dragged Nigerian Artist Burna Boy to the cleaners after he threw shades at Davido ahead of his forthcoming album. Davido shared series of videos and photos from his snap chat story to his Instagram announcing his new project which is an album he is set to release in July. Burna Boy took the chance to shade Davido in several post and claimed that Davido’s father bought him his music career because he was incompetent. It will be recalled that Davido posted a Photoshop of himself and Wizkid wearing a dress which looked like a herbalist and described themselves as the greatest of all time. Few hours after Davido shared videos and photos to announce his new Album release in July, Burna Boy threw shades at him and made fun at Davido. According to Burna Boy, July will be a funny mouth and he won’t laughing. “July will be very funny, and i shall laugh accordingly. You cannot play football, everybody knows you cannot play and you are an embarrassment to the team. But your daddy bought the football team” he shaded. His words didn’t go down with most people as they divert their anger and displeasure with him by throwing insults at him.
