Former special assistant to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan who is also the host of Transformation with Reno Omokri, a Christian teaching TV show broadcast on San Francisco’s KTLN and Detroit’s Impact Network has slammed baby mamas getting pregnant as means of livelihood. Taking to his twitter account recently, he wrote, ” Being a baby mama is not a job. If you want an income, go get a job, instead of getting pregnant. ”Bringing a baby into this world without a marriage, a stable home and a stable income, is a wicked thing to do. A child is not a means to a livelihood. Being a baby mama is not a job. If you want an income, go get a job, instead of getting pregnant.
