Spain international and Atletico Bilbao striker Aitz Aduriz has announced his retirement from professional football at the age of 39.

Unfortunately, my body has said ‘enough’. “I can’t help my teammates the way I would like to, nor the way they deserve. That is the life of a professional athlete. Simple. Very simple,” part of his statement said. Is first spell with Athletic as a youngster saw him mostly confined to the reserves and out on loan to Burgos in the third tier.
