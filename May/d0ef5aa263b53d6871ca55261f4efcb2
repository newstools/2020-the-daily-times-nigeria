He said, “Just as it was a Ramadan like none other, the Eid-il-Fitr celebrations marking the end of the fasting this year too would be epochal. “I am sure there would be very few Muslims alive today – if any – who had witnessed a Ramadan fasting like the one we just had, and Eid celebration such as we would have this year without the mandatory congressional prayers. “We are taught in the scripture and the Sunnah of Noble Prophet Muhammad (SAW) that God would test our faith individually and as an Ummah (entity). “The current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic is a test from Allah (God), and having fasted as we are enjoined as Muslims, let us continue to remember that it is part of our faith to protect all lives and to abide by regulations from those in authority, especially during a time of great uncertainty like this.”
