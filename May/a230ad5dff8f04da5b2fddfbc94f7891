Nigerian Medical Association Lagos State Chapter has reversed its stay-at home directive. In a statement signed by the Chairman, Dr. Saliu Oseni, and the Secretary of the association, Dr. Moronkola Ramon, the NMA on Thursday said that the decision to reverse the order was necessary after the Nigerian Police Force and the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu resolved the issues and assured the safety of all health workers. “The leadership of the Association has followed the turn of events while monitoring the situation. The Nigerian Police Force has reached out to the association to clarify and give assurance of cooperation with all health-workers. “This, they have also done in the media. The Executive Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu was exemplary as his timely intervention from the late hours of May 19th helped prevent worsening of the situation”. The NMA has assured its members that no one will be harassed in the course of performing their lawful duties. Recall that the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Lagos State Chapter directed its members to immediately proceed on an indefinite sit-at-home protest, starting from 6.00p.m on Wednesday. The association gave the directive in a joint statement by its Chairman, Dr. Saliu Oseni, and Secretary, Dr Ramon Moronkola. However, the NMA National President Dr. Francis Faduyile, said: “I am not aware of a strike, but I am aware of a sit-at-home. A strike means there is an industrial dispute. However, a sit-at-home came to be because the Police has said that it will not exempt them from the restriction.
