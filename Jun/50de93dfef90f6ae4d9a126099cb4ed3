Taxpayers in Lagos state have been given till June 30 to file their Annual Tax Returns. This is according to the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) in a statement explaining that yearly returns for individuals (employees and self-employed persons) that was initially due for May 31, can now be filed on or before June 30. The extension is in line with the government’s continuous effort to provide the much-needed relief to taxpayers and mitigate the economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic. LIRS Executive Chairman, Mr Ayodele Subair was quoted in the statement. “As the Lagos State government keeps abreast of global best practices in containing the Covid-19 pandemic and eases the effects of an economic downturn on taxpayers and residents of the state, LIRS had initially extended the deadline for filing annual tax returns for two months, from the statutory March 31st of every fiscal year to May 31, 2020.

All that they have to do is to simply log on to the e-Tax platform.” He said updates on business operations and alternative payment platforms of the service could be obtained by visiting the LIRS website, checking its various social media platforms or calling its Customer Care Centre.
