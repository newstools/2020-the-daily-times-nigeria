Paris Saint Germain captain Thiago Silva wants to move to the Premier League before he retires from football. Silva will be a free agent next week after refusing to ink a deal with the French champions. There had been rumours last week that Silva would like to join Carlo Ancelotti at Everton but there is interest from Wolves and Tottenham according to Goal. Carlo Ancelotti and Jose Mourinho will be entering their first full seasons in charge of their respective clubs’ next term, while Nuno Espirito Santo could be preparing his Wolves team for Championship league  football. With the Ligue 1 season having been curtailed, PSG had expected the player to be at the club until the end of the season to help them in their Champions League campaign but Silva just as Edison Cavani will be representing new teams next season. The player is said to be keen of the Brazilian squad that will participate in the 2022 World Cup in what might be his last major tournament with the national team; the player having amassed 89 caps for his country since his debut in 2008.
