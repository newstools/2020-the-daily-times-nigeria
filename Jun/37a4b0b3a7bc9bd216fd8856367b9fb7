Lille manager Christophe Galtier announced that Arsenal target Victor Osimhen will be leaving the club this summer. The Lille manager said in a press conference: ‘Regarding Victor and Gabriel, yes, I’ve known for a long time that they’re leaving.’ ‘They’re working hard with us in the meantime. We’re working on the players who are currently here and those likely to replace them. ‘Of course, the club is working to replace him [Osimhen].’ Lille who has sold some of his best talents in recent years are expected to hold out for a large transfer fee similar to the £72million paid by Arsenal for Nicolas Pepe last year.
