The Federal Government has said banks and hotels in the country could resume ‘normal working hours’, effective June 2. The National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Sani Aliyu, stated this during a briefing in Abuja on Monday. He said, “Effective from Tuesday, June 2, the easing of the lockdown will be characterise by the following: “There will be full opening of the financial sector with banks now allowed to operate normal working hours five days a week.” He added that the PTF has reviewed the 8pm-6am curfew earlier announced by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) during his address on April 27. Aliyu said the curfew would now be between 10pm and 4am daily. He said, “The nationwide curfew will remain in place but the timing will be reduced to 10pm and 4am. Aliyu said, “Effective from Tuesday, June 2, the easing of the lockdown will be characterise by the following: “Hotels may reopen but must observe all mandatory non-pharmaceutical intervention.” “Restaurants other than those in hotels must remain closed for eating but are allowed to priotise and continue practicing the take-away system. “Bars, gyms, cinemas and night clubs are closed till further evaluation.” The national coordinator stressed that the goal of the review is to allow the full restoration of the Nigerian economy.
