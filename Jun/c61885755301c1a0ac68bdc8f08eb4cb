Lagos – The Women Arise for Change Initiative (WA) and the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy (KIND) on Thursday called on the Federal Government to do more to end killing of innocent citizens. The groups made the call in a statement jointly signed in Lagos by WA Founder, Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin, and KIND Founder, Hafsat Abiola-Costello, to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the death of Alhaja Kudirat Abiola. Kudirat, Wife of the late Chief  MKO Abiola, the widely acclaimed winner of the  June 12, 1993,  Presidential Election, was killed in Lagos on June 4, 1996, by gunmen. “As we remember Kudirat today despite the coronavirus pandemic that has made impossible physical gathering like we used to do in her honour, we must remain steadfast on the principles she died for. “We demand an end to wanton killings in the land,” the groups said in the statement. They also called for intensified efforts for freedom for  Leah Sharibu and all others in the captivity of terrorists. “We say to these heroes and heroines of the struggle for a better society: Thank you for your sacrifice. Court orders police, DSS not to arrest CUPP spokesman, Ugochinyere “To those of you who  paid with your lives, you did not die in vain; you died for our collective struggle, and we will always remember what you stood for. “To Kudirat, whose date and fond memories vile dictators and their repressive measures could not obliterate, to Kudirat whose contributions and sacrifices no pandemic can override or overrule, we say: Continue to sleep well in the bosom of your maker.” (NAN)
