NERC said to ensure improved customer service delivery, the commission had continued to monitor and audit customers’ complaints handling and resolution process by DisCos. According to the commission, it is continuously monitoring the operation and efficacy of its forum offices which have been set up to redress customers’ complaints not adequately resolved to their satisfaction by the responsible DisCos.
