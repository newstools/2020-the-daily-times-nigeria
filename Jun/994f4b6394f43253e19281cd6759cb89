Following Nigeria’s support to fight for justice for Uwa Omazuwa, 100 level student of the University of Benin,raped and killed recently, Reno Omokri has also called on Nigerians to remember slain Christians who are yet to get their justice. Omokri made this call on Monday on his twitter handle. He wrote, ”On July 9, 2016, Pastor Eunice Olawale of RCCG, a mother of 7, was killed in Abuja while on evangelism. Till date, no one has been tried for her murder. Where was Nigeria’s outrage? Our bigotry is worse than America’s racism, yet that is our focus. ”On June 2, 2016, evangelist Bridget Agbahime was beheaded in Kano. Her suspected beheaders were arrested. On November 4, 2016, they were released on the orders of Kano’s AGF. Where was Nigeria’s outrage? Our bigotry is worse than America’s racism.” On July 9, 2016, Pastor Eunice Olawale of RCCG, a mother of 7, was killed in Abuja while on evangelism. Till date, no one has been tried for her murder.
