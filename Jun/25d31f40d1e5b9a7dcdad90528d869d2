Man City coach, Pep Guardiola fears his players are not ready for the exhausting demands of the Premier League restart. Guardiola’s reigning champions will host Arsenal on Wednesday in the second game of the Premier League’s return to action following the coronavirus break. City play again on Monday when Burnley come to the Etihad Stadium and the pace does not drop until the planned end of the season in late July. With Premier League chiefs determined to play the remaining 92 matches in less than six weeks and teams given only a short time to prepare, City manager Guardiola is concerned that his stars are not fully fit for such a hectic schedule. “We are ready to play one game, but three days after another and four days after another, we are not ready,” Guardiola told reporters in a video press conference on Tuesday.
