The Independent National Electoral Commission INEC has rejected the notice of governorship primary result sent to it by the ruling All Progressives Congress. The electoral body hinged its decision on the fact that the result notice was signed by only the party’s acting national secretary. It said that was contrary to the commission’s guidelines, which require that such result notice should be jointly signed by the national chairman and national secretary of the political party. The commission conveyed its position to the APC in a letter dated June 22, 2020, and signed its Secretary, Mrs Rose Oriaran-Anthony.
