Hoffenheim has announced the sacking of Alfred Schreuder as head coach just four games before the end of the Bundesliga season, over differences in the way they believe the team should develop. “We had different views on important detailed issues, meaning that cooperation beyond the end of the season no longer makes sense,” explained TSG director of professional football, Alexander Rosen. Hoffenheim is in seventh place on 43 points and battling for a Europa League place next season. “Unfortunately we could not agree on a common path for the future of the team,” Schreuder said. Schreuder, who had a contract to 2022, had arrived at the start of the season from Ajax. His assistant and brother Dick Schreuder will also leave.
