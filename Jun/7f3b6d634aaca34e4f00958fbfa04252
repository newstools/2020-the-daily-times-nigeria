The Ogun state House of Assembly has pledged to collaborate with the National Assembly for a uniform legal framework to ensure stringent punishments against rape menace in the society. Speaker Olakunle Oluomo, stated this while addressing the state chapter of the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS) led by Mrs. Aishat Adeyiga, at the assembly complex in Abeokuta on Friday. Oluomo, who decried the effects of rape on the victims, especially women and the girl-child in the society, justified the basis for a review of existing laws in line with current realities. According to him, this will be with a call for a sustained campaign against drug abuse by the youth, as well as more orientation for young girls, especially on the need to avoid indecent dressing. He commended the association for its commitment towards evolving measures against rape. Oluomo remarked that the high rate of drug abuse and in-take of other harmful substances in the society remain a major contributor to the rape menace. Earlier, Adeyiga said that the association had decided to join their counterparts in the 36 states of the federation and the FCT to convey their unalloyed support for the imposition of the death penalty and capital punishment for rapists. She explained that rape victims mostly include babies while the older women are often used for ritual purposes, adding that the dastardly act often leads to long-lasting psychological and physical trauma. Adeyiga therefore, canvassed for the death sentence for potential rapists to serve as deterrent to others.
