Hoffenheim beat Borussia Dortmund 4-0 on Saturday with Croatian striker, Andrej Kramaric has becoming the first Hoffenheim player to score four goals in a Bundesliga game. Kramatic took his campaign tally to 13 as Europa League-bound Hoffenheim moved above VfL Wolfsburg to finish in fifth place on 52 points. Dortmund were already confirmed as runners-up to Bayern Munich, but after this embarrassing home defeat finished 13 points adrift of the champions. Dortmund did threaten early when Norwegian teenager Erling Haaland forced a full stretch save out of visiting goalkeeper Oliver Baumann in the fifth minute. 29-year-old Kramaric dominated the game.
