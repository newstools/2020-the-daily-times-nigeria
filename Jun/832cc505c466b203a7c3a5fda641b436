The Juventus superstar overtook longstanding rival Lionel Messi to regain the crown as football’s highest-paid player, Forbes announced last week. English Premier League agrees on 5 substitutes for season restart The business magazine has now also confirmed that Ronaldo’s earnings of $105 million took his total career income to more than $1 billion. Forbes pointed out that the 35-year-old has received $650 million in salary during his 17-year career so far, and is expected to reach $765 million when his current contract ends in June 2022. The other $350 million to take his total income to more than $1 billion comes from sponsorship and endorsement deals. No other footballer has come close to Ronaldo’s earnings, not even David Beckham, who ended his career with an estimated income of $500 million, half of which came from endorsement deals. Ronaldo’s $105 million income in 2020 is based on basic salary and win bonuses worth $60 million, plus another $45 million from sponsorship deals with the likes of Nike and Herbalife, as well his own “CR7” brand.
