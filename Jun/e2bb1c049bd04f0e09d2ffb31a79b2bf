One of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Ondo State, Mr. Ifeoluwa Oyedele yesterday expressed optimism that the party will overcome its current crisis and come out of it stronger. He said the leadership crisis could not be divulged from scrambling for political positions and influence. Oyedele who picked his nomination form at the Abuja national secretariat of the party said what APC is witnessing currently is not strange in politics. He said as a founding member, who designed the APC logo, he expected the party to go through rough patches because of the large number of legacy groups that amalgamated to form the party. Oyedele bemoaned the sorry state of infrastructure and the neglect of social amenities in the three senatorial districts of the state by the current government under Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. He expressed displeasure over government handling of education, health and other sectors that have direct impact on the lives of the governed. Promising a new lease of life for the people of Ondo State, the aspirant said he is competent to transform the state into a prosperous one. Oyedele promised to â€œreform education sector, upgrade schools and teaching staff, equip laboratories, provide conducive atmosphere to security agencies to improve lives and property of the people.
