UEFA maintains that the French Ligue 1 ended their season rather prematurely, but, there still is a chance to resume their campaign and play to completion. In the latter days of April, all sporting events in France were canceled until September to curb the spread of the coronavirus, an announcement that made the Ligue 1 decide void their season and bring it all to an abrupt end. It now comes off as a rushed decision, considering the likes of the Premier League, LaLiga and the Serie A are all gearing up to join the Bundesliga in restarting their seasons. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin, however, believes they can return. Ceferin wrote in an official UEFA communication as quoted by Goal: “We would first of all like to clarify that it is the competence of national associations to decide on the format of their domestic competitions, in particular by taking into account the circumstances and restrictive measures specific to the country. “As mentioned by UEFA a few weeks ago, the French authorities’ decision to cancel the Ligue 1 season was taken relatively early. “Nevertheless, and provided that the national associations are able to coordinate with the competent national authorities a potential restart of domestic competition, August 2, 2020, would be an appropriate date to end the domestic competitions.” After the cancelation, PSG was crowned league champions, with Marseille and Rennes are due to join them in the Champions League, while Toulouse and Amiens are replaced by Lorient and Lens in Ligue 1.
