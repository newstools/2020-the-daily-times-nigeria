The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika on Monday listed some conditions which are currently being considered before the final reopening of domestic flights following weeks of lockdown. Sirika listed the conditions during the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja. He said following the directive of the Federal Government for domestic flights to prepare to resume operations June 21, technical and health factors will be considered. “Regarding the tentative date for reopening of domestic flights from 21st of June, the explanation is that, this is an industry that is highly regulated, it borders on safety and efficiency. “On the technical aspect, there are aircraft that have been parked for a few months and not been run. We want to ensure that between now and that time, these aeroplanes are good and safe to fly. “The maintenance for aircraft is either usage or calendar time and there are protocols to the use of such aircraft. So, the airline industry needs to be able to bring those machines to safe operations,” he said. Sirika added that on the issue of flight crews and carrier crew, efforts are being made to ensure that they get their licence valid again for operations. He noted further that the medical aspect also needs to be considered as every pilot has a licence which must state that he is fit and able to carry out operations. According to the Aviation Minister, even the airport needs to be prepared to adopt the new way of life which must reflect social distancing. “Even the airport where all of these activities will be done needs to be prepared to get ready to accept this new way of air travel,” Sirika said.
