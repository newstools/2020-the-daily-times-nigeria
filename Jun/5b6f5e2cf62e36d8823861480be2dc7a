Red Devils have booked a place in the FA Cup semis after trashing their hosts Norwich City 2-1. After a goalless first half, United took the lead through Odion Ighalo in the 51st minute. Todd Cantwell grabbed the leveler 75th but Norwich were reduced to ten men after Tim Klose was sent off. The match went for extra time as the two sides could not get the winner. In the 118th-minute club captain, Harry Maguire netted the winner to book a place for the Red Devils in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. In the early exchanges, Manchester United kept the possession, as they tried to break Norwichâ€™s defense. The Red Devils went close as Shaw floated a ball to the back post and Maguire attacked it. The United captain didnâ€™t make the best of contact but his looping effort had Krul concerned as he plucked the ball from under his crossbar before falling to ground on the right side of the goal line. The skipper struck late to send us to the #FACup semi-finals. Get in! ðŸ’ª#MUFC @Chevrolet Norwich responded with a counter-attack. It was two versus one as Cantwell threaded a pass across Pukki but the ball was misplaced and allowed Shaw to recover before the Canaries were crowded out.Â Norwich had worked themselves into several decent positions so far but they were lacking the clinical touch when it matters most.
