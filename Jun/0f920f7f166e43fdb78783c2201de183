Manchester United have given three reasons for extending Odion Ighalo’s loan deal until the end of January 2021. The club made this known Twitter on Monday. According to reports, Ighalo joined Manchester United in a Deadline Day move in January from Shanghai Greenland Shenhua. He has scored four times in eight appearances in all competitions prior to the suspension of the Premier League because of coronavirus.

The ex-Super Eagles striker earlier revealed how he spent his lunch money on watching Manchester United as a child. Ighalo said he had always loved Manchester United. Growing up in Nigeria, Ighalo and his siblings were big fans of the club and would set aside money given to them for school dinners so they could watch their favourite team. United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said he would love Ighalo to win a cup for his childhood club. Solskjaer said, “They (Shanghai Shenhua) have been great towards us, allowing him to play for his dream club “It’s been a dream for him and hopefully he can finish what he started and win a trophy with us.” Ighalo’s current deal at Shenhua runs out in December 2022. He was earlier asked to sign a contract offer until the end of 2024 worth £400,000 a week, but the player prefers to stay at Manchester United despite taking a pay cut.
