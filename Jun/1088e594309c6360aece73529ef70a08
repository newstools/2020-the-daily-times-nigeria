The leadership of the All Progressives Congress in River State has recommended former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in the state, Worgu Boms, to fill the vacant post of the Deputy National Secretary of the party. He is to replace Victor Giadom, who resigned in 2018 to contest the 2019 governorship election as a running mate. Giadom had resigned to be running mate to Tonye Cole, Rivers governorship aspirant in the 2019 election. National Vice Chairman, South South, Hillard Eta, disclosed this to journalists in Abuja on Saturday at the National Secretariat of the party. He said, “You are aware that on Friday a competent court of jurisdiction declared Chief Victor Giadom as not being a member of the National Working Committee and should never parade himself as such. “Even before then, there was a resolution by the NWC asking the South South zone of the party which I head to transmit a name for his replacement or filling of the vacancy made possible by his resignation to contest as deputy governorship candidate of our party in Rivers State. “I want to announce to the world that I am in receipt of the name of a distinguished member of this party from Rivers State to the zone for ratification in the person of Nwogu Bond Esq, a former Attorney-General of Rivers State.
