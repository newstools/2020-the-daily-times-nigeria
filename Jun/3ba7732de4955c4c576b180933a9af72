Nigerian singer and mother of three, Di’ja has condemned child marriage. The singer made this known while taking about Obstetric Fistula. She wrote, “Our young girls need to be allowed to grow up before doing grown man and women things like marriage and anything to do with sexual reproduction. If you really mean well you will at least give her until 18 years old, while honestly guiding her spirit. Not every one means well.” A follower mentioned that 18 is still too young and Di’ja added,“That’s why I say “at least” legally the laws. But even that IS too young. Especially in today’s world.” Raising awareness about Obstetric Fistula, she wrote,“DO YOU KNOW ABOUT OBSTETRIC FISTULA? Very high in young girls early marriages whose reproductive systems have not fully developed. READ ALSO Xavi hopes to coach Barcelona in the future Ya Allah we ask you for guidance.
