Newly unveiled Afro-Pop and RnB artiste, Olakira whose real name is Ade Ebenezer releases video to brand new single ‘in my Maserati’. The Wakanda Jollof crooner, Olakira, inspired by his love for the luxury vehicle brand, delivers a smooth, soft and groovy style that is true to his sound. ‘In my Maserati’ is replete with strings and drums, easy on the ear, groovy with straightforward lyrics thrown in a mix of Yoruba, Igbo and pidgin languages. The producer, composer and songwriter woos the lady of his dreams in this track which is the perfect love song when you find the one you can’t do without. The lacing of endearing words in vernacular in this track also lends the song an original feel which Nigerians love. Like Olakira says in his lyrics, ‘somebody needs somebody’. If you like soft, groovy, uninterruptive music, this song is for you. This happy song is the kind of song that you put on repeat for as long as you’d like. ‘In my Maserati’ video is shot in Lagos, Nigeria and directed by Clarence Peters.
