…Calls for amendment of Criminal Code Act The Senator representing Anambra Central Senatorial District, Senator Uche Ekwunife, has called for the amendment of the Criminal Code Act to provide for a more stringent punishment for rapists. She said this while contributing to a motion recently at the plenary of the Nigerian Senate. Senator Ekwunife noted that rape damages a girl emotionally and physically, and puts victims in trauma which often times doesn’t heal throughout their lifetime. According to Senator Ekwunife, while there may seem to be many reported cases of rape, the reported cases are only a fraction of the rape cases which occur and are unreported because the victims are either too scared to speak or are afraid of possible stigmatisation. While tasking the Police to speed up investigation to fish out and punish those who raped and killed the University of Benin undergraduate, Vera Uwaila, Ekwunife called on the Senate to use this opportunity to amend the Criminal Code Act to provide a stringent condition that will deter people from destroying our young girls.
