The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on behalf of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and the PDP family, mourned the death of former Governor of Oyo state and immediate past acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abiola Ajimobi. The PDP described the death as a national tragedy and a huge loss not only to the APC and his state, Oyo but also to the entire nation. Indeed, our party is still in shock and deeply saddened over the news of the death of Senator Ajimobi, especially at this time, when our nation needed his wealth of experience and statesmanship the most. According to Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan the PDP National Publicity Secretary he said that Senator Ajimobi was an exceptionally brilliant administrator, outstanding legislator and a man of peace, who made immense contributions and sacrifices towards the unity as well as political stability and development of our dear nation, Nigeria. Senator Ajimobi was an excellent administrator and broad-minded Nigerian, who put the good of the nation ahead of other considerations in his political life. Our party sincerely commiserates with the Ajimobi family, particularly his widow, Mrs. Florence Ajimobi, President Muhammadu Buhari, the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the government and people of Oyo state. The party prayed God to grant the nation the fortitude to bear the loss and eternal repose to the faithful departed.
