Consistent with its inter-agency  collaboration policy, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to enable the tax agency to verify the completeness and accuracy of Value Added Tax) elements and other taxes payable in the transactions of telecom operators. Quoting the Executive Vice Chairman of the NCC, Umar Danbatta, in a statement, signed by the Director of Public Affairs, Dr Henry Nkemadu stated that diligence and appropriate due processes were undertaken to conclude the MoU, as the commission took its time to understand the import of the MOU. “Our concern, as a regulator of the telecoms industry is that we needed to be sure that it is not another way to tax telecoms operators, who are already dealing with multiple taxation issues. “We have also ensured that the integration of the solutions with telcos’ transactions systems will not, in any way, impact the cost and quality of service delivery by the operators to telecoms consumers,” he said On his part, the Executive Chairman, FIRS, Muhammad Nami, said that the MoU was mainly to ascertain the completeness of tax transactions of mobile service providers with the Federal Government. He, however, expressed gratitude to the NCC for its partnership with the agency. “With the MoU, the FIRS will be able to integrate an application programming interface (API) technology solution with the systems of telecom operators,” he added.
