The Katsina State governor, Rt. Hon. Aminu Masari has pleaded with his supporters to stop routing for him to aspire for another office after his tenure, as he has no political ambition after 2023. Masari insisted that he won’t aspire to any political office after leaving office as a two-term governor of the state. The governor who spoke with reporters at Government House Katsina, said he would rather prefer giving opportunities to the younger ones to emerge, adding that it is because he would be 73 by 2023. The former House of Representatives Speaker said:  “I made my positions very clear, as far as my plans are concerned.

I am not going to and God willing by 2023, I will be 73years old and by that time, I am out.”
