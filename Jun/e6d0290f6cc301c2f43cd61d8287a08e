Paris Saint-Germain sporting director, Leonardo has confirmed Thomas Tuchel will stay for next season, and has also denied seeking out potential replacements for the German at Parc Des Princes. Tuchel moved to Paris in the summer of 2018, initially signing a two-year deal to succeed Arsenal-bound Unai Emery. After guiding PSG to the Ligue 1 title in his first season in charge, the former Borussia Dortmund boss signed a one-year extension through to the summer of 2021. The club were 12 points clear at the top of the table when the current Ligue 1 campaign was halted because of coronavirus in March, with the authorities later opting to curtail the season and crown PSG champions once more. Despite that domestic success, there had been rumours PSG were on the lookout for possible replacements, with former AC Milan and Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri reportedly under consideration. Such speculation has seemingly been put to bed by Leonardo, who also has not ruled out the possibility of Tuchel signing a new deal to further extend his stay in the French capital. “He has one year left on his contract and he will be on the bench next season,” Leonardo told JDD. “He has done well, the results are good. An extension? We have time to think about it.” When asked about reports of the club scouring the market for potential replacements, Leonardo was emphatic in his response. “I surveyed no coach. Never,” he said. It’s important to say it. “With Tuchel, we talked, he knows everything. It’s very clear, there’s nothing with anyone.” Leonardo has also spoken of his frustration at the potential departures of teenagers Tanguy Kouassi and Adil Aouchiche, admitting it is a challenge to try and persuade young players to stay at the club if they cannot be guaranteed regular playing time.
