World Number 1 in men’s singles tennis, Novak Djokovic has tested positive to the novel coronavirus. The Serbian positive case follows Grigor Dimitrov, Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki who revealed they had coronavirus after playing at Djokovic’s Adria Tour competition. 33-year-old Djokovic played fellow Serb Troicki in the first event in Belgrade. The remaining Aria Tour events in Banja Luka and Sarajevo have now been cancelled, Djokovic’s brother Djordje has confirmed. Djokovic’s in a statement said; the moment we arrived in Belgrade we went to be tested. My result is positive, just as Jelena’s, while the results of our children are negative. Everything we did in the past month, we did with a pure heart and sincere intentions. Our tournament was meant to unite and share a message of solidarity and compassion throughout the region. The Tour has been designed to help both established and up and coming tennis players from south-eastern Europe to gain access to some competitive tennis while the various tours are on hold due to Covid-19. It was born with a philanthropic idea, to direct all raised funds towards people in need and it warmed my heart to see how everybody strongly responded. We organised the tournament when the virus had weakened, believing the conditions for hosting the Tour had been met. Unfortunately, this virus is still present, and it is a new reality we are learning to cope and live with. I am hoping things will ease with time so we can all resume lives the way they were. I am extremely sorry for each individual case of infection. I hope it will not complicate anyone’s health situation and everyone will be fine. I will remain in self-isolation for the next 14 days, and repeat the test in five days. Djokovic has won 17 Grand Slam singles titles, the third-most in history for a male player, five ATP Finals titles, 34 ATP Tour Masters 1000 titles, 14 ATP Tour 500 titles, and has held the No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for over 280 weeks.
