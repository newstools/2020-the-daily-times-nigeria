Manchester City registered an easy 3-0 win over Arsenal at Eithad Stadium on Wednesday. The EPL match saw Raheem Sterling opening the scoring at the stroke of half time before Kevin De Bruyne added the second through a penalty kick and Phil Fodden wrapped up the three points deep in injury time. Substitute David Luiz delivered a horrendous show in a torrid 25-minute cameo appearance. Brought on as a substitute in the 24th minute following an injury to Pablo Mari, the Brazilian’s error led to Raheem Sterling’s opener (45+2) the Brazilian was later shown a straight red for fouling Riyad Mahrez in the box. Belgium international Kevin De Bruyne made no mistake from the spot before substitute Phil Foden rounded off the scoring to condemn Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta to a heavy defeat on his return to the Etihad Stadium. The result sees City delay Liverpool coronation party as the Citizens consolidate their position in the top four.
