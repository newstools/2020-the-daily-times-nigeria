Two straight weeks of dramatic finishes on the PGA Tour men’s golf fans have high expectations for this week’s Travelers Championship. This week also marks the first event since the 2019 Zozo Championship in October when Rory McIlroy is not the outright favorite in an event he’s playing in. Justin Thomas, who was the favorite that week, is a co-favorite with Rory this week after JT fired a final-round 63 on Sunday. Interestingly, JT’s history at TPC River Highlands isn’t so strong … he has only one finish better than 30th place in six starts, but that included a T-3 in 2016 after a final-round 62. Rory has a T-17 in 2017 and a T-12 2018 to his record. Travelers Championship Odds; Justin Thomas: 12-1 Rory McIlroy: 12-1 Bryson DeChambeau: 14-1 Jon Rahm: 18-1 Brooks Koepka: 20-1 Webb Simpson: 20-1 Patrick Cantlay: 25-1 Dustin Johnson: 28-1 Justin Rose: 28-1 Paul Casey: 28-1
