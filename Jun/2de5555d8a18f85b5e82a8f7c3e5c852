Werder Bremen’s substitutes and unused players completed a training session while Theodor Gebre Selassie was required to visit the club doctor. Selassie picked up an ankle injury during Werder Bremen’s 3-1 loss to Mainz and had to be substituted before halftime. “We will have to monitor the pain and swelling day-by-day and see how we can increase his workload throughout the week before deciding whether he will be available for Köln,” explained head coach Florian Kohfeldt.
