A drunken driver has knocked down the Commanding Officer, 2 Battalion of the Nigerian Army, Ribadu Cantonment, Kaduna, Lt. Col. Abraham Gbileve, in Markudi, Benue State. Gbileve died after his friend crushed him while reversing his Toyota Camry car last Tuesday. Punch Metro gathered on Sunday that the deceased resumed as the commanding officer of the battalion about three months ago and travelled to his hometown in Benue State on vacation. Gbileve, a regular combatant officer, was said to have sent his driver and orderly on an errand, while he had a few drinks with his friend. After the outing, his friend reportedly offered to take him back home, but as he reversed his car, he reportedly lost control and crushed Gbileve, who was sitting on a chair at the open pub, and killed him on the spot.
