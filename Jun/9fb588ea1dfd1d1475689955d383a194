The wife of the President Mrs. Aisha Buhari has called on the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to release release her assigned Staff who are still in Police custody. Recall that there were reports that the President Buhari’s Personal Assistant and Private Secretary, Sabiu ‘Tunde’ Yusuf was at loggerheads with the first lady after she denied him entry into Aso-rock. She reportedly ordered that Tunde should go on mandatory 2-week self-isolation as he recently returned from a trip to Lagos. Yusuf who is reportedly one of the most influential people around President Buhari flatly refused and pushed his way into the Villa. Worried that his presence could expose them to danger, the first family intervened in the matter on Thursday but things quickly spiralled out of control after the security attached to the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, moved in and had Yusuf removed from the Presidential Villa. Miffed by this, Tunde had the First Lady’s ADC, Usman Shugaba, Escort Commander and other policemen attached to the first family arrested and detained. Confirming the report on Friday night, Mrs Buhari took to Twitter to call on the IG of Police to release the security men. She tweeted; That Covid-19 is real and still very much around in our nation is not in doubt. Consequently, I call on all relevant Government Agencies to enforce the Quarantine Act signed by Mr. President and ensure no one is found violating this law and the NCDC guidelines especially on interstate travel without the necessary exemptions for movement of essentials. Anyone who will do well to remember that does that should at the very least be made to under go a 14 days mandatory isolation no matter who the person is, no one should be above the law and the Police command Finally, I call on the IGP to release my assigned Staff who are still in the custody of the Police in order to avoid putting their lives in danger or exposure to Covid-19 while in their custody.
