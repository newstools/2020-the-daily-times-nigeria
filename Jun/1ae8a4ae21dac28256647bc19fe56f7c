Kaduna  – The Coordinator, Forum for Better Organised Nigerian League, Vincent Akinbami, has called on the Federal Ministry of Sports and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to make adequate preparations before the resumption of domestic football league. Akinbami said on Thursday in Kaduna while addressing newsmen that with the funds from FIFA, CAF and the support that might come from the government through the ministry, the 2019/2020 league season should continue, so as to produce true champions. He said the leagues that have started like the NPFL and NNL should be concluded, while the ones that have not started should be cancelled. “The premier league and national league should be concluded, national league champions will be promoted but there should be no relegation. “While the Amatuer/Nationwide and the women’s league should be cancelled and wait until next season.” He suggested how the dates should be managed from now until next season. “Continue the 2019/2020 season from July 2020 and end it in November 2020. Start the 2020/2021 season in January 2021 to end in June 2021. “Now align our calendar with Europe and other African countries for 2021/2022 season starting it in August 2021 to end in May 2022. “We are used to starting our league in January, so we can start 2020/2021 in January to make amends,” he said. He, however, insisted that the 2020/2021 season must not start until demands of the group are met. (NAN)
