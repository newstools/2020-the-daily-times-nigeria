A 15 year-old boy who was caught defiling a 6-year-old boy has been arrested by the police. According to a Legal Practitioner, Abdullateef who shared photos of the boy via his twitter page, the boy lured the 6-year-old into an uncompleted building where he committed the dastardly act. He wrote, ”This filthy, despicable, loathsome, vile animal was caught in an uncompleted building beside my house this morning sleeping with a 6 year old girl. He has since been taken to the police station and the girl has been taken to the hospital for medical examination. ”If not for my intervention, he wouldn’t have made it to the police station. Me sef chop beating small.The victim’s mother was distraught, the girl was brave & it was her scream that alerted us. ”I’m very sad & angry. When will these stop? We need to do better as a society. ”Sadly the animal succeeded and he confessed to penetrating the little girl.” This filthy, despicable, loathsome, vile animal was caught in an uncompleted building beside my house this morning sleeping with a 6 year old girl. He has since been taken to the police station and the girl has been taken to the hospital for medical examination. pic.twitter.com/iHsacm5Zx9 If not for my intervention, he wouldn't have made it to the police station.

Apparently he's minor, he claims to be 15. Although I'm sure the police will get the truth from him. Even if he's 15 he should be sent to a juvenile detention center as you said.
