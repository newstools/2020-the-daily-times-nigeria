Nigeria’s first ever Virtual Wedding will finally make its debut this weekend (Friday, 19- Sunday 21, June, 2020) thanks to Mrs. Molara Akande, a seasoned wedding planner who runs Just Weddings (JW) and the founder of APPOEMN (Association of Professional Party Organizers and Event Managers of Nigeria which she founded in 2011. Speaking recently, Molara Akande who has over 19 years of professional experience in the industry and has often been referred to as the very first professional wedding planner in Nigeria, explained the reason behind the event “Let’s get back to the present situation of things… Covid-19 is changing the world as we all know it and being a professional in a world that now needs social distancing, we are looking at evolving, hence why we came with this. People have been planning their wedding and we don’t expect them to just cancel or put off their plans because of the virus, so JW events came up with a virtual wedding fair called the Virtual Wedding Fare. Don’t forget that I am the creative mind behind Wedding Fare, an annual bridal fair which takes place in Lagos, is in its 5th year, this year” She spoke more about the fair “The wedding fair is really for people getting married between the year 2020/ 2021 be it a bride-to-be, a wedding/event vendor and anybody who has a passion for the wedding industry. Event vendors will be given a platform to showcase themselves, especially those who have had to go back into the background due to the pandemic; they will now have the opportunity to advertise themselves to prospective clients on a large platform. We see it more as a Wedding Market for brides to be and potential vendors who are looking for deals and bargains, from the comfort of their homes.’ Though growing up as a kid she never saw herself as a future wedding planner, but the fact that she was born into the family that was very social gingered up her interest “Though I never planned to be a wedding planner, I guess the fact that I was born into a family that was very social, ignited my interest.
