The state chapter in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Mr. Alex Kalejaye said they are deeply pained by the developmwnt, “The state chapter is deeply pained by the untimely passage of the political strategist, and shrewd administrator. “As Chairman of the Ondo State Oil Producing Area Development Commission (OSOPADEC), Pastor, as he was fondly called, worked assiduously for the transformation of the Niger Delta part of the state. “It was during his tenure that several projects were initiated, and completed, in both the federal constituency and neighbouring local governments.

The party will definitely miss his contributions during the next governorship election. “Chief Omojuwa was a committed party man; a grassroots politician and a great mobiliser. A vacuum has been created that would be difficult to fill. “On behalf of Ondo APC, I  condole with his immediate family, the people of Ugbo Kingdom, and his political associates across the zone. May God grant them all the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. I also pray that God have mercy on the soul of the departed,” the APC said.
