Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is a formidable politician and has been in the trenches, fighting for democracy in this country Pastor Tunde Bakare, the Serving Overseer, the Citadel Global Community Church, has said. Pastor Tunde Bakare reacting to reports that  the All Progressives Congress (APC) Natilan leaders  will  contest for the 2023 presidential election said that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu  has the right to so and that he is entitled to everything that he plans to do. Bakare said though Tinubu spoke to him  personally, has not said anything to him about such, and that   he doesn’t even need to tell him. He also said that he can only wish him the best and that God will help him with his aspirations. He said Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is a formidable politician; Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has been in the trenches, fighting for democracy in this country. He is entitled to everything that he plans to do. He has not spoken to me personally, but he doesn’t even need to tell me. I can only wish him the best and that God will help him with his aspirations. But that does not mean that the horses that are ready for battle, every one of them will win. The Bible says the horses may be ready for the battle, victory is of the Lord. I wish him all the best. He is entitled to it, he has paid the price and if God grants him life and he throws his hat into the ring, our own desire is that whoever will do Nigeria good and move this country away from doldrums, may God assemble the best of the North and the best of the South, the most competent and the fittest to be the ones that will run the affairs of our nation and not the dregs of society.
