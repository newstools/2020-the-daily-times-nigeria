Nigerian-British Anthony Joshua, the man currently holding three of the four world title belts, has no interest in taking on Mike Tyson. In an interview with The Sun of UK, Joshua said ‘With all due respect I wouldn’t when asked if he would step in the ring with the 53-year old. ‘Even if I fought Iron Mike and beat him, I think I’d be the only one cheering. People would boo. He is a legend. He is the greatest boxer of the modern era. ‘There are only two recognised champions the world knows of, Ali and Mike Tyson — the most recognised faces in the world when it comes to boxing.’ Joshua has made no secret of his desire to fight another Tyson, WBC king Fury.
