According to the mother of the victim, Maimuna Adam, she slept with her windows open to allow fresh air into her apartment. Later in the night, she woke up and found out that her baby who was supposed to be sleeping by her side, was missing. She raised alarm and her neighbors went in search of her baby. They found her in an abandoned building with her pants ripped from her body and bloodstains around her honeypot.
