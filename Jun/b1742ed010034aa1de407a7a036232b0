Nigerian forward, Taiwo Awoniyi, is ‘conscious and responsive’ after suffering a head injury while in action for Mainz in Sunday’s 1-0 loss at home to Augsburg, his coach Achim Beierlorzer has stated. Awoniyi was taken to the hospital on Sunday after he was knocked out after an aerial challenge with Augsburg’s Felix Uduokhai. Play was delayed for about five minutes before the 22-year-old was stretchered off after 23 minutes. He was replaced by Karim Onisiwo. “Taiwo is conscious and responsive,” Beierlorzer said during his post-match interview. “He has suffered a severe concussion but can remember everything. “Uduokhai is also spending the night in the hospital as a precautionary measure.” Meanwhile, Mainz sporting director Rouven Schroder has declared that the club is open to extending Awoniyi’s loan deal for another season.
