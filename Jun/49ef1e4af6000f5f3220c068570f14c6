They will also explain why June 12 was deservedly declared a public holiday by the Federal Government in honour of late Chief Moshood Abiola, who won the June 12, 1993 election that was annulled by the Ibrahim Babangida-led military government. EFCC threatens Okorocha, releases 5.7bn out of N7.9bn seized Governor Sanwo-Olu will explain to the youths how his administration has ensured that none of the citizens’ rights have been trampled upon in the last one year, the work done daily to ensure residents of Lagos get the dividends of democracy they agitated for while marching on the streets to demand for the return of civilian government over 20 years ago. Sanwo-Olu and his deputy will at the event inform the youths how they had been preparing themselves for leadership before assuming office last year. The participants at the virtual event will be given the opportunity to make their contributions and ask the speakers questions.
