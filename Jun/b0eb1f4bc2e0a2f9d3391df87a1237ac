Benue state plans to construct 500 kilometres of roads and six agro logistics through the Rural Access and Agricultural Marketing Project (RAAMP). State Project Coordinator, Mone Aernyi, disclosed this on Thursday in Makurdi, when he led the management team of the project on a courtesy visit to the Vice Chancellor of Benue state University, Makurdi, Prof. Msugh Kembe. The coordinator who said the three senatorial districts in the state are to have two slots each, added that the hubs are agriculture based, stressing that they were areas that engage in massive agricultural activities. “It is the desire of the project to reconstruct some major markets in the state to encourage massive agricultural activities. We will build stores, storage facilities and provide water and solar light across most major markets in the state in order to enhance agricultural activities,” he said. While soliciting for collaboration from the university to enable it succeed on its mandate, he noted that the collaboration is necessary since the institution has all it takes to make the scheme deliver on its mandate. Responding, Prof. Kembe, pledged the readiness of the university to support the project because it was people -oriented, adding that it was targeted at uplifting the rural areas. “We will collaborate with you to enable you achieve your goals. We are looking forward to a healthy and robust collaboration. We have the best laboratories in food processing in the country. We will offer them to you to make use of them for free,” the vice chancellor promised. Meanwhile, the institution’s Deputy Vice Chancellor, Prof. Godwin Achinge, commended RAAMP for their plan to construct and reconstruct both rural roads and markets, saying it will go a long to improve security situation in the rural areas.
