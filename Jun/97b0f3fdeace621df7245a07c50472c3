English Premier League side Liverpool are interested in Fiorentina midfielder Gaetano Castrovilli according to reports from Italy. Portal Il Messagero, as cited by HITC indicates that the Jurgen Klopp side will be going out for the player as they look to strengthen their midfield in the coming season. According to the reports, Castroville is valued at £44 million with the player having been a consistent figure at the Serie A side this after two years on loan with Cremonese in the Italian second tier. Before the league was cut short by a coronavirus, Castrovilli had played 24 games in the Serie A scoring three goals and providing two assists.
