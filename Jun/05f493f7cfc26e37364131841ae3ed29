Fast rising Nigerian singer, Johnson Omole better known as AJETYCOON recently poured out his mind via his instagram page on the issue of “ALL LIVES MATTER” and he has these to say; The belief that some people are inherently better and biologically more endowed is really false because God created all men alike! The impact of social intolerance among people has been experienced in manifold perspectives and proportions and the underlying causes are not far-fetched; racism, snobbery, bullying, segregation, tribalism, religious intolerance are a few of these anomalies. Over the years, these factors have led to a surge in violence threatening lives and contributing substantially to poverty, high mortality, and immigration crisis! Racism has taken a huge share of this social misconduct over the years! Racism is a prejudice, discrimination or antagonism directed against someone of different race based on the understanding that one’s race is superior. Such attitude is often found to a larger extent in the Anglos towards the non-Anglos because the Europeans believed originally that the indigenous blacks are heathen, basically uncultured and intellectually backward! In the US, racism bothers on class division to justify the brutal system of coerced or forced labour called slavery. Ajetycoon however noted that racism, xenophobia, tribalism and diverse forms of intolerance are prevalent problems in many societies but we can stand against these problems as human rights champion and advocate!
