When the chips are down you will understand in full what I mean.” ‘Sylvia stop losing sleep whether I was on that set or not remember the scene shot at Mrs. Isangs house? We had a little prayer meeting and I specifically made a prayer request with one of the major cast in attendance and to the Glory of God it has long been answered.” “If your issue is with how long I was there, were you filming in My Husband’s hotel room? or were you on set to monitor a newly wedded Woman’s movement?” “In all this, you and your co-host can be rest assured that I stand firmly with my Husband. I am a Mother of Four Girls, A practicing Accountant, if any of my Bosses ever molested me I would never go back to them to ask for favors talk less of being cordial with them over a period of 13 Years….dear Sylvia please be guided.” ‘To everyone standing and running with Sylvia well-done you are all entitled to your opinions but remember just as much as a Girl Child needs a lot of protection so does the Boy Child. When all the concentration is on the Girl Child is there a third gender for the Girl to associate with? No wonder there are so many broken homes, no wonder so many damaged Men roaming the World.” “My Husband has built a brand for the past 25 Years through sweat and blood, if you and your gang think you will cast aspersions on him you sure picked a wrong person.” Meanwhile, the Film Whatsapp group which is not a court of law has advised Sylvia to institute a legal action against the film director if she’s desperate and sure of the allegation.
