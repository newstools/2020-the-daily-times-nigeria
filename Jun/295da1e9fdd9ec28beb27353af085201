Sterling Bank Plc has introduced One Partner Programme that would allow customers the benefit of enjoying passive monthly income. The bank’s Divisional Head, Retail and Consumer Banking, Mr Shina Atilola said on Tuesday, that the programme was targeted at entrepreneurs and upwardly mobile young Nigerians and Diasporans. Atilola said in a statement that the programme allows customers to generate a second income by referring their family and network of friends to use unique Sterling Bank products. “Joining the One Partner Programme will ensure consistent and long-term income for customers on each newly introduced relationship. “So, the more people a customer refers, the more each customer gets paid on their monthly balances for up to five years. “The possibilities are truly limitless despite the times,” Atilola stated. According to him, “One Partner Programme can also serve as a source of income for employed persons who have a good network. “Obviously, everyone does have a network in their social, religious, and other cycles. “The programme is providing a platform for people to use their networks to improve their net worth,” Atilola added. He said the referral scheme was targeted at self-driven and passionate individuals who can leverage their relationships to create value. “Such individuals could be entrepreneurs, professionals, ex-bankers, community leaders, civil servants, and pensioners, among others. “The One Partner Programme is also open to non-Sterling customers, and it is an easy-to-register scheme.”
