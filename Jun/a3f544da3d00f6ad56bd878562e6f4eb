In line with its mandate to provide and refocus professional excellence for the marketing communications industry, the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria, APCON is set to conduct the May/June 2020 Professional Diploma in Advertising (PDA) examinations. In a recent statement made available to newsmen in Lagos, the Acting Registrar, Mrs Ijedi Iyoha said: “The exams previously set to hold on June 1 to June 5, 2020, could not take place due to the temporary suspension of our operations in compliance with Federal Government’s directive to curb the spread of Coronavirus by locking down the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States, thus making us to reconsider this decision and move the date forward to Monday, June 22 to Friday, June 26, 2020.” The APCON boss also noted “The Council is determined in its resolve to ensure quality service delivery, by providing the needed knowledge and skills in a bid to give every deserving candidate an opportunity to become a registered member of the advertising profession in Nigeria.” She further explained that all eligible candidates are required to visit any APCON office to enrol for the examinations before the close of business on Thursday, June 11, 2020.
