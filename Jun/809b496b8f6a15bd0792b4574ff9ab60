Two-time Grand Slam tennis champion Naomi Osaka joined the chorus of athletes condemning the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, Derek Chauvin posting pictures of protests from the Minnesota city on her Instagram account. “Just because it isn’t happening to you, doesn’t mean it isn’t happening at all,” wrote Osaka, whose mother is Japanese and whose father is Haitian. “It’s funny to me that the people who wanna wear chains, blast hip hop in the gym, attempt to get dapped up, and talk in slang are suddenly quiet right now,” added Osaka.
