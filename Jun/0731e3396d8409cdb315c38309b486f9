As at April 29 when the last official data was released, 509 cases and 21 deaths had been recorded in Tanzania. BBC reported that Mr Magufuli had said last week that only four patients were receiving treatment in the largest city, Dar es Salaam. He also dismissed a US embassy warning that hospitals in Dar es Salaam were “overwhelmed” and that the chances of contracting the virus was “extremely high”. Kenya closed its borders with Tanzania and Somalia due to rising cases of imported COVID-19 cases.
