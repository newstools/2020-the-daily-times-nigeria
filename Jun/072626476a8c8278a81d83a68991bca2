As the search for the killers unravels, Mabel goes on to challenge the decision that declares incumbent governor Idris Sani (Sani Mu’azu) as the winner of the election. Speaking about the upcoming release of the film, the director Ishaya Bako said, ‘We’re excited to share this film with the world. We’ve had some very interesting feedback from the screenings of the film at the cinemas, and especially at the campus tour, we carried out at the end of 2019. “This year has been a particularly tough one for everyone, for obvious reasons, one thing that hasn’t changed is that people are able to watch good entertainment from the comfort and safety of their homes”. ‘4th Republic’ is a gripping thriller that is reflective of the Nigerian system, from our do or die politics to our ironic optimists. The producers say the film is one of the most important Nigerian films to watch. The release of the film is slated a day after June 12 – Nigeria’s Democracy Day, one of the most significant days in the country’s post-independence political history. ‘4th Republic’ is written by Emil B. Garuba and Zainab Omaki; the film is co-produced by Griot Studios Ltd. and Amateur Heads Productions with Bem Pever, Ishaya Bako, Kemi ‘Lala’ Akindoju, with Ummi A. Yakubu serving as producers.
