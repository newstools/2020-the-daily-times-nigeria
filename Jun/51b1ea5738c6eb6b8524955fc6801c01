Tottenham Hotspur has cancelled their friendly game against Championship Reading FC that was scheduled to take place on Saturday. Tottenham were slated to take Reading just a day after the loss to Premier League rivals Norwich at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Friday in a two-hour friendly ahead of next week’s top-flight meeting with Manchester United. Match will no longer take place, forcing Jose Mourinho into a rethink with Spurs now just six days out from their first Premier League meeting for 13 weeks, according to standard sport. In the Friday friendly, striker Harry Kane, Moussa Sissoko, Heung-min Son and Steven Bergwijn who had missed Spurs last games all featured as they played four 30-minute quarters. In the game, Erik Lamela gave the hosts the lead but Josip Drmic and Mario Vrancic ensured that the game ended in a loss for the hosts in what was their second win at Tottenham in just over three months. According to the reports, the plan had been to try two different XIs across two days but that would not happen as Mourinho now forced to have other plans ahead of League resumption. Spurs welcome United to north London in what will be one of the first games when the Premier League returns. Spurs are four points below fifth-placed United and will hope to bridge the gap as they seek to qualify for the Champions League.
