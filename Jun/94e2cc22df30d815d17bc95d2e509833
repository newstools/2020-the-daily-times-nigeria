Ten persons were on Wednesday night feared killed along the Asaba- Ogwashi Uku Road in Delta state following a multiple accident. An eyewitness, Nnamdi Emeka, who spoke to our correspondent at the scene, said the accident involved two trucks, one Delta Line bus, and three other vehicles heading towards Ogwashi Uku. According to him, the vehicles crashed into the stationary truck, leaving 10 persons feared killed and others sustaining injuries. He said: “The stationary truck caused the accident because for days the truck had been there and was not removed until Wednesday night around 9pm when the vehicles heading toward Ogwashi Uku crashed into it because the area was very dark. “The victims were rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba, with fatal injuries and I doubt if they will survive because one of the victim’s eyes was dangling on the ground.” But, police officers who were seen at the scene on Thursday, refused to comment, but confirmed that the accident was fatal.
