The former Aviation Minister, and Peoples Democartic Party stalwart,  Femi Fani-Kayode,  has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to stop the arrest those criticizing his government over the spate of insecurity in the country. He also told the President to ‘please arrest those that kill his people and not those that criticize and protest against your cruel and incompetent Government.” Fani-Kayode was reacting to the arrest  of Nastura Ashir Sharif after he protested the massive killings and insecurity in the north. Fani-Kayode said “I commend the courage of the people of Katsina State and the North Western zone of Nigeria for finding the courage to come out and express their disgust and horror at MBuhari’s refusal and inability to stop the carnage that their people are being subjected to by the terrorists. 717 reported rape cases totally unacceptable, says FG “I condemn the arrest of the young man that led the anti-Buhari protests in Katsina and I call for his immediate and unconditional release. President Buhari, please arrest those that kill your people and not those that criticize and protest against your cruel and incompetent Government.”
