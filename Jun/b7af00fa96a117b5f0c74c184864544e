Moved by the way private Jet owners  flagrantly conducted illegal operations, especially during the COVID-19 Lockdown,  the  Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has again, reaffirmed and warned that the use of private jets for charter flight services shall be met with penalty. The NCAA has introduced new measures for immediate implementation which mandate that aircraft duly registered as privately owned should not be used for commercial charter. In a circular dated June 24, 2020, and addressed to the Directorate of Operations and Training (DOT), Directorate of Airworthiness Standards (DAWS) and the Directorate of Air Transport Regulations (DATR) of the NCAA, its Director-General, Capt Musa Nuhu, directed the application of the new regulatory regime. According to the circular, private aircraft, known as Operations Specification Part G, which have PNCF would, henceforth, be stopped from operating for hire and reward. “All aircraft listed under OPS SPECS PART G (commercial wet-lease) that is either in non-compliance or in violation of any part thereof of NCAR (Nigerian Civil Aviation Regulation) Part 9.2.3.4(b) shall be grounded with effect from Monday 29, June 2020,” the circular said. According to the NCAA, the Authority has started disciplinary actions on its personnel who were privy to allowing private aircraft for charter services. The director general of the NCAA in the letter said: “DATR shall provide a comprehensive list, details of all PNCF holders and all aircraft listed under their permit; all PNCF holders shall be reminded of the terms and conditions of the permit, especially the non-commercial nature. Any violation will attract penalty under Nig.CARs, including revocation.” He also directed the concerned directorates in the agency to develop procedures and guidance to ensure all NCAA staff complied with NCARs in processing all applications and submit a single comprehensive report to him on the implementation of items mentioned above, measures are taken and the reasons why these violations were allowed and not resolved in the first instance.
