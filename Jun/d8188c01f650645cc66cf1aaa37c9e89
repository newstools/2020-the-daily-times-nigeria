In a bid to support agricultural value chain in Nigeria, Keystone Bank has approved the sum of N734 million through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS) Programme to the Nigerian Farmers Group and Cooperative Society (NFGCS). This is even as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through its Director of Development, Mr Yusuf Yila, announced the approval of N432 billion to support farmers for the 2020 planting season. Divisional Head, North and Public Sector Directorate, Keystone Bank Plc, Akinsanmi Falaki, made this known during a final inspection tour to the NFGCS’s farm settlement in Ga’ate, Nasarawa State.Falaki noted that the bank was also committed to increasing the loan offer based on established value and structures, which greatly exceeded their expectations.While commending the farm’s infrastructures, he said, “we have found a good partner in you and this has to do with the value you can bring on the table for mutual benefit and will continue to work closely with you to increase the relationship we have built overtime.” This is my third visit to a farm in my entire life but I have never seen anything like this considering the size of the infrastructures here.“Unlike others, here you have a farming community where the key actors live in the farm to monitor the day to day operations of the farm,” he said
