Italian giants Juventus have agreed a £72.5m fee with LaLiga side Barcelona for the signature of Arthur Melo. According to reports, similar to that of Jorginho at both Chelsea and Napoli. Last month, Arthur told both clubs he is not interested in leaving the Spanish capital but Juventus are still hoping to persuade him. Further reports suggest that the Italian side has also offered Arthur more wages to his current deal at Nou Camp that is believed to be £4.5m a year. The 23-year-old is expected to feature for the Catalans tonight when they take on Athletic Bilbao and according to Sky Sports, the midfielder is still keen to remain at Nou Camp and fight for his place. The two clubs are also said to want to conclude the transfer before June 30th but Juve sporting director Fabio Paritici has denied this. He has admitted publicly, however, that player still needs to be convinced.
