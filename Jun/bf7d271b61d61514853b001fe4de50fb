Abuja  – The National Working Committee (NWC), of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has displayed the credentials of all six Edo governorship aspirants participating in the party’s primaries slated for June 22, for screening. APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said this on Monday shortly after pasting of aspirants’ credentials at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja. Issa-Onilu said that the party’s leadership pasted the candidates’ credentials to ensure transparency and that the party could learn and correct its past mistakes and experience. “You will recall what happened in Bayelsa, we thought we did the best we should, but it turned out that we did not do enough. “So the best thing we have to do now is to go beyond ourselves to the things that may not be known to us. “We have put it out here for anybody who has information to help the screening committee,” the party’s spokesman said. According to him, APC NWC is also taking official steps to verify some of these documents to be sure that it does the right thing. “By mere putting it on the board here, making it transparent, putting it before the public, it does mean that people who know them very well: school mates, aquintances, friends and even enemies, could come up with whatever they have. “We are expecting help from whatever angle it could come from.
