Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Dele Alli will miss the Premier League restart after being suspended for one match over a post on social media about coronavirus. The Football Association found Alli guilty of misconduct after posting a video on social media of himself at an airport wearing a mask and apparently mocking a man of Asian appearance. Alli deleted the video within minutes of posting it and apologised twice but has still been punished by the FA. The 24-year-old was also fined £50,000 and must undertake an education course after he was found guilty by an independent regulatory commission. He apologized again on Twitter on Thursday: “In response to the FA decision, I would like to apologize again for any offence caused by my behaviour. “It was an extremely poorly judged joke about a virus that has now affected us more than we could ever have imagined. “I’m grateful that The FA has confirmed that my actions were not racist because I despise racism of any kind. We all need to be mindful of the words and actions we use and how they can be perceived by others.” Alli will not play Tottenham’s first match back, the visit of Champions League qualification rivals Manchester United on June 19.
