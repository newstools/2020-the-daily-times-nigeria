A leading construction company, Hartland Nigeria Limited, has donated a ventilator in support of the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration’s response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the state. The Area Manager, Hartland Nigeria Limited, Elias Jouni, who presented the equipment to the State Government, in Government House, Benin City, said the firm is committed to supporting government’s efforts in the fight against the spread of the pandemic. He suggested that the ventilator should be installed at the Auchi Isolation Centre in Etsako West Local Government Area of the state, to boost the capacity of the centre to attend to COVID-19 patients at the facility. The Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu, who received the equipment on behalf of the government, commended the company for the support and sustained partnership with the government in curtailing the spread of COVID 19. “We are partners in progress in Edo State and will continue to collaborate to deliver the dividends of democracy to the people of the state. Buhari an epitome of lawfulness, says Obaseki as he leaves APC “This machine will be properly utilised in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 in Edo. The ventilator will help patients who need aid with their respiratory system when they are being treated for the virus. The machine is coming at the right time as the number of confirmed cases in Nigeria is on the rise.” He added: “It is not surprising for us because since March, we have been able to study and understand the situation. Luckily, it has not been as bad as was expected. The machine came at the right time and I will instruct the Commissioner for Health to immediately install it and put it to use for the benefit of the people.” Shaibu urged the people to protect the elderly and those that have underlying health issues by observing social distance, wearing facemasks, using sanitizers and regular hand washing.
