She said that Olu Jacobs was still alive, against the false information about his death. The guild spokesperson warned mischief makers and enemies of the industry to quit from such wickedness that would not benefit the industry. “It’s so annoying that some people take pleasure in disseminating fake news, and going extra mile on the social media to declare a living person dead. “For crying out loud, this act is very bad, and I see it as malicious; but the truth of the matter is that Olu Jacobs is alive, very hale and hearty,” she added. Chinda-Cocker described Olu Jacobs, as “a seasoned Nollywood leading star, role model and most influential African actor of all times who had starred in over 120 movies. Similarly, his wife, Joke, had earlier debunked the rumoured death of her husband. According to her, the family found the development so depressing that members had to speak out. She added, “In fact, the birthday of Olu Jacobs (who laughed off the whole matter) is next month.”
