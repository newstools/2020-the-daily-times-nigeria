David Luiz has signed a new one-year contract with Arsenal. A pre-season signing from Chelsea, David Luiz has endured mixed form with the Gunners and produced an error-strewn display in last Wednesday’s loss to Manchester City before being sent off. Despite that, technical director Edu described the experienced defender as a key player for the club, whose hopes of Champions League qualification suffered a further blow after Saturday’s loss to Brighton and Hove Albion. “David is a really important player for us,” he told the club’s official website. “He has played most of our matches this season and has been important for the team. “His passing, his communication with the team on and off the pitch. He helps everyone.”
