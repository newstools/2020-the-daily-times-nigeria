On May 5, 2020, a 62-year old royal father popularly known as Aketewi of Iketewi, Oba OlusijiOgungbemi, his son, Gbenga (21) and one other person simply identified as Sarafa Olayiwola allegedlytook turn to defile a 14-year old girl in a town called Ilare Ijesha in Osun State.Oba Ogungbemi is a native of Ilare Ijesha and monarch presiding over the affairs of Iketewi, a tiny villagebetween Ilare Ijesha and Ilahun in Obokun Local Government Area of the state.The victim was living with her aunt, Esther Ogungbemi, in Ilare at the time of the incident.The hapless girl, according to the police, is already carrying a baby for the three suspected rapists.The incident though took place on Tuesday, May 5, the trio of Ogungbemi, Gbenga and Sarafa were notpicked up until the following week Thursday, May 14, after the guardian of the victim reported thematter at the police station.Specifically, the guardian involved the police when the girl started throwing up and later tested positiveto pregnancy.After a thorough investigation, the police found a prima facie case against the royal father and the twoothers and decided to transfer the case file to Osogbo Magistrate Court for trial.They have since been arraigned on a three-count charge of conspiracy, rape and sexual exploitation.During arraignment, police prosecutor, ASP John Idoko, told the trial magistrate, Dr Olusegun Ayilarathat the trio conspired with one another to sexually exploit the 14-year-old girl and impregnated her inthe process.But from the dock, the royal father and his alleged accomplices denied the allegations and challengedthe police to go ahead with their trial if it had evidence against them.Separate counsel for the monarch and his son, Mrs Yinka Popoola, and that of the third defendant,Tunbosun Oladipupo, later applied for bail of their clients on liberal terms, assuring the court that theywould not jump bail.But the trial magistrate refused to give a bench ruling on the bail application as he adjourned till May 18for a well-considered ruling while he ordered that they should all be remanded in police custodypending ruling.While Oba Ogungbemi was cooling his heels in detention, the Ijesa North Traditional Council announcedhis suspension at an emergency meeting held on Sunday, May 17 at the palace of Elegboro of Ijebujesa,HRM Oba (Engr.) Moses Oluwafemi Agunsoye.In a statement jointly signed by the President of the Council, Elegboro of Ijebu-Jesa, Oba MosesAgunsoye and the Secretary, Olomu of Ijaregbe, Oba Edward Adetimo on Monday, they directed him tosteer clear of all activities of Ijesa North Traditional Council and Obokun Chieftaincy Committee pendingthe decision of the court in the matter. The Council also used the opportunity to clear the name of Oba Adejoro Otebolaku, the Owalare of Ilarewho was initially identified as the royal culprit and the Alahun of Ilahun whose image was used toillustrate the story on the social media when the news broke.We have carefully followed the unfolding story regarding the alleged rape of the Osun teenager.We note that the royal father and his accomplices have denied the allegation and that the judiciary isalready seized of the facts of the case and at this stage, can only say that the entire incident remains anallegation until proven.We therefore call on the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) to appoint one of its members, well versed incriminal jurisprudence, to join in the case as amicus curiae to monitor and ensure that Justice is done inthe case.We also urge the prosecution and the judiciary to do everything possible and necessary to ensure thatthey get to the root of the matter and ensure that justice is not only done in the case but seen to havebeen done.If at the end of the trial, the accused persons are found guilty, the judiciary must come with the fullweight of the law against them.On the other hand, if the accused persons are found to be innocent after trial, unreserved apology mustbe tendered to them, particularly the royal father, whose image as a representative of a sacredinstitution, has not only been soiled but terribly battered.
