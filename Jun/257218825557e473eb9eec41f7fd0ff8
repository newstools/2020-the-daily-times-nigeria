Berlin – Union Berlin players greeted around 30 fans outside their stadium after Sunday’s 1-1 Bundesliga draw against Schalke 04 —- a match played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus epidemic. Throughout the match, songs could be heard from the group of home fans who gathered in the forest behind the traditional home end of the stadium. “We want to see the team,” was then chanted at full time and the players responded. Goalkeeper Rafal Gikiewicz and several others went from the pitch to the stadium’s boundary fence and, standing on beer and picnic tables, briefly gave thanks for the support. “We have got onto the tables and had a look,” said Robert Andrich. “That is naturally fantastic and at this time. Really nice.” Andrich’s opening goal for the hosts was celebrated by the fans and police saw no need to intervene. Gov Ikpeazu tests positive for COVID-19 Berlin’s current coronavirus rules permit small gatherings and those outside the stadium observed social distancing. However, fans gathering at stadiums for closed door games is supposed to be avoided. The German football league (DFL) presented a detailed hygiene concept to politicians in order to resume play behind closed doors after a two-month suspension from mid-March.(dpa/NAN)
