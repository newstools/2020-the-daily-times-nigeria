The Ogun State Police Command has arrested a 17-year-old girl, Seun Adekunle, for conniving with her boyfriend, Basit Olasunkanmi, 25, to fake her own kidnap. Preliminary investigation revealed that the Olasunkanmi, who conceived the idea, and brainwashed the teenage girl into following through, had contacted Adekunle’s family, demanding N500,000 as ransom for her release. According to a statement by the Ogun Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, the mother of the girl reported the matter to the Enugada Police Division. Oyeyemi stated that the mother told the police that her daughter had left their No. 32 Agura Road, Abeokuta residence for Lafenwa market on June 1, but did not return home. He said the mother also told the police that the family was called two days after to be informed that their daughter had been kidnapped and ransom demanded. “She said the caller warned her not to make the mistake of reporting to the police if she still needed her daughter. Upon the report, the Enugada Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Baba Hamzat, a Superintendent of Police (SP), quickly led his detectives on technical and intelligence based investigation which led them to the hideout where the girl and her boyfriend were hibernating and pretending to be with kidnappers. “They were promptly arrested and brought to the station. Preliminary investigation revealed that the boyfriend who is a butcher was the one who brainwashed the girl and lured her into the devilish plan because he needed money to settle some only God knows problem. “Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, has ordered the immediate transfer of the case to State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), for further investigation and possible prosecution,” the statement added.
