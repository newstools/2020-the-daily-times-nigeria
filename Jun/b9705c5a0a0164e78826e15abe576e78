Sen. Ali Ndume has agreed to stand as surety for the former Chairman of Pension Reforms Task Team (PRTT), Abdul-rasheed Maina. His counsel, Chief Joe Kyari Gadzama (SAN), made this known, on Tuesday, while arguing another motion before Justice Okon Abang for further bail variation of the defendant. Maina was admitted to bail by the court but he could not meet the conditions. He had to approach the court to vary the bail terms. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Maina is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over alleged fraud. He has been in detention since last year. One of the conditions given by the court is for the defendant to provide a senator who would stand as a surety for him. The matter is ongoing as at the time of filing the report.
