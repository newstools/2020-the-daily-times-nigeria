The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has declared that Insurance companies across the country have up to September 30, 2021, to complete their recapitalization process. The Commission also segmented the ongoing recapitalisation process for insurers and reinsurers, directing them to meet 50 and 60 per cent respectively of their minimum paid-up share capital by December 31, 2020, and complete the process by September 30, 2021. NAICOM disclosed in a circular issued in Abuja on Tuesday and signed by its Director, Policy & Regulation, Pius Agboola, entitled: ‘Segmentation of Minimum Paid-Up Share Capital Requirement for Insurance and Reinsurance Companies in Nigeria’. The circular was numbered; NAICOM/DPR/CIR/25-04/2020, dated June 3, 2020, and sent to all insurance and reinsurance companies. The insurance industry regulator noted that the incidence of COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to proceed with the December 31, 2020 recapitalisation deadline, hence, a review of the recapitalisation deadline, therefore, became imperative in order to mitigate likely negative consequences of the pandemic on the exercise. With the aforesaid, NAICOM noted that it then extended and segment the recapitalisation process into two phases which allowed 50 per cent of the minimum paid-up capital for insurance and 60 per cent for reinsurance to be met by December 31, 2020, while the operators are to fully comply with the approved minimum paid-up not later than September 30, 2021. NAICOM maintained that insurance companies that failed to satisfy the required minimum paid-up capital by the end of December 31, 2020 May be restricted on the scope of business they will transact. The Commission tasked the insurance and reinsurance firms to ensure they fully comply with the approved minimum paid-up capital by September 30, 2021.
