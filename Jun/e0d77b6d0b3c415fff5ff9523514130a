Turkish side, Ogenyi Eddy Onazi has acquired a mansion in Lekki worth 120 million naira. The super eagles player mansion joins other Nigerian football stars like Man United player Odion Ighalo who have houses in the neighborhood. On 22 September 2014, Onazi signed a two-year contract extension with Lazio until 2018. Lazio had previously received transfer enquiries in the summer transfer window by three Premier League clubs Everton, Southampton and Sunderland with interest from German, French, Spanish and Russian clubs also being reported. On 31 May 2015, his 88th-minute goal for the final score of 3–2 in Lazio’s win over Napoli helped secure the last Champions League place for the club. He made his debut for the senior Nigeria national team in an African Cup of Nations qualification match against Liberia. His first goal came in his second international match, a 3–1 friendly win over Venezuela in Florida. Onazi was called up to Nigeria’s 23-man squad for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations
