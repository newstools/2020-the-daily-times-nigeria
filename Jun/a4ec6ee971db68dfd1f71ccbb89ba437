Manchester (UK) – Pep Guardiola is set to appoint his former mentor Juanma Lillo as his assistant coach at Manchester City, reports in the Spanish media on Friday indicated. Manchester City did not replace Mikel Arteta when he left his role as Guardiola’s assistant to become Arsenal manager last December. Now, Spanish newspapers Marca and AS said Guardiola was set to hire Lillo, who recently left Chinese Super League side Qingdao Huanghai. The 54-year-old Lillo has been a coach for 35 years, working as an assistant to Jorge Sampaoli with Sevilla and the Chile national team. He has had limited success in a number of first team coaching roles at several clubs, including Real Sociedad, Almeria and Atletico Nacional. In 2005, he signed Guardiola for Mexican side Dorados Sinaloa. “Guardiola is like a son to me,” said Lillo in a 2012 interview with FIFA, explaining that the former FC Barcelona midfielder went to see him after Lillo’s Real Oviedo side had been beaten 4-2 by Barca.
