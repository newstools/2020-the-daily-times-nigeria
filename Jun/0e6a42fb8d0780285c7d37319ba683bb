A Federal High Court in Abuja has rejected a suit by Senator Dino Melaye, challenging some provisions of the controversial Control of Infectious Diseases Bill 2020, also referred to as the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Bill. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu who passed the judgment on Tuesday, held that her court lacked the jurisdiction to hear and determine issues raised in the suit by Melaye, who represented Kogi South Senatorial District in the Eight Senate. Nigerian army sued over illegal arrest of lance corporal Idakpini and wife Justice Ojukwu upheld the preliminary objection filed against the suit by the respondent, the Nation reports. The judge was of the view that the issues raised in suit was not justiciable, as a Bill could not be a subject of litigation until it becomes law. Listed as respondents to the suit are the Clerk of the National Assembly, the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and the Inspector-General of Police (IGP). Justice Ojukwu struck out the name of the IGP as a party to the case, on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to disclose any cause of action against him. Melaye had on May 5, 2020, filed the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/463/2020, urging the court to delete sections 5, 8, 15, 16 and 17 of the bill which he said constituted a violation or would likely violate his rights under the Nigerian Constitution, the African Charter on Human and Peoplesâ€™ Rights as well the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.
