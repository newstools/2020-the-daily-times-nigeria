Billionaire businessman cum politician, Ned Nwoko has announced that his young wife and Nollywood actress, Regina Daniels is expecting a baby. The ex-lawmaker, who took to his Instagram page to share the good news, also shared photos of the pregnant star with an ample baby bump,“It is now official. I am excited to announce that my baby is having a baby @regina.daniels,”he wrote. A report had also claimed that the politician acquired a house for Daniels in an undisclosed location in London, United Kingdom, for her to stay ahead of the baby’s arrival. Recall that in 2019, Regina Daniels was reported to be pregnant with the billionaire’s baby and there were even claims that she was four months gone at the time.

A report at the time that insiders claimed caused a rift between the lovers. Regina then returned back to the social media scene but photos she shared on there were really questionable as she looked rather slimmer than what she looked like before. Well, the pregnancy is confirmed and the actress also shared some videos of her baby bump. She wrote on her journey of motherhood,“I have never been this happy before , This feeling of becoming a mum is the most amazing journey of my life.
