Ajimobi said his assumption of duty was in line with Section 14,  subsection 3 of the APC Constitution. “The section states that the deputy national chairman shall act as the national chairman in the absence of the national chairman from his zone,” he said. He became APC Deputy National Chairman (South) in March, when the National Working Council  (NWC) of the party, wrote to the Southwest to fill the vacant position,  following the appointment of  Otunba Niyi Adebayo as a Minister. Ajimobi said that his appointment received the support of five out of the six South West states of Oyo, Ondo, Osun, Ogun and Lagos with only Ekiti protesting the nomination. He said that his appointment into the NWC of the party was affirmed by a Federal High Court. APC National Publicity Secretary Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu on Tuesday, announced Ajimobi as Acting National Chairman of the party.
