I remember when I had no idea how I was gonna move on in life after my masters degree, you were there to take me in with little or no experience whatsoever about running production. You said you would give me a job without knowing me from anywhere, without knowing my capabilities.” “All I had was my educational qualification and thirst to work and learn on the job. Prior to this I had tried to work in other production outfits but none took me not because I wasn’t qualified but because they probably didn’t believe in me. “ READ ALSO No fee is charged for NIS recruitment -CG “You on the other hand, believed in me, took me as a son, scolded me when I messed up all in a bid to make me better at my craft.
