The full impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on businesses is yet unknown, but firms are devising strategies to cope with the new normal. For MultiChoice, partnering with and integrating other content providers like Netflix and Amazon into its offerings might be one of its winning strategies. According to available information on its website, MultiChoice has signed a deal with Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com, its US rivals to offer its streaming services through its new decoder. Market watchers believe the move will help the Africa’s pay-TV giant retain its teeming subscribers and attract potential viewers. Also hinting at the deal during a Bloomberg telephone interview, MultiChoice Chief Financial Officer, Tim Jacobs, said: “There is little overlap between content on Multichoice’s Showmax, that is now 50per cent local, and a service like Netflix at the moment, hence we find deals with other video-on-demand services complementary. “We will continue to film local productions, taking specific precautions such as splitting production teams.” He continued: “What would typically happen is we would get a commission on whatever revenue gets generated by customers coming from our platform.” However, Netflix has also made an effort to produce more African content. Dramas “Queen Sono” and “Blood and Water”, both South African, debuted on the service this year, supported by extensive marketing campaigns. MultiChoice’s financials stated that the group recorded 8 per cent, year-on-year subscribers’ growth and 22per cent growth in subscribers’ revenue in Nigeria.
