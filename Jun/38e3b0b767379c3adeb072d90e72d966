Liverpool winger Taiwo Awoniyi was taken to hospital after suffering a concussion playing for German club Mainz, where he is on loan. 22-year-old was hurt after a clash of heads with Augsburg defender Felix Uduokhai in the first half. The former Nigeria youth international landed awkwardly and, after a delay, was carried off on a stretcher with his neck in a brace. Mainz said Awoniyi was responsive and will spend the night in hospital. This came after a frustrating campaign prior to the restart that saw him play just 147 minutes in six outings across seven-and-a-half months, and his attitude has been praised by sporting director Rouven Schroder. “He could actually say: ‘I’ll be gone in the summer anyway’. But instead, he says: ‘Guys, what can we do?’,” Schroder said of Mainz’s relegation battle. Awoniyi, who has yet to make an appearance for Liverpool since joining in 2015, has played in 12 Bundesliga games for Mainz since joining on a season long loan last August.
