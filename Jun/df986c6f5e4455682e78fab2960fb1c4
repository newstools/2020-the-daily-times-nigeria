Victor Akachukwu Maxwell, professionally known as Maxxiebaby can best be described as the quintessence of a “star musician” in the popular Afro-fusion musical genre. He is a prolific rising star, spontaneous and eclectic in his sounds, who weaves intuitive lyrics for his songs, which lends them an almost ‘follow-come’ (natural) rhythmic feel. Maxxiebaby, who started out in his musical career in 2015, has carefully sculpted his musical sound to a fusion of contemporary urban rhythms, the gift of storytelling and more importantly, history. Apart from his thought-provoking lyrics, evident in his just released debut single “Paradise”, is a message of true love, hope and appreciation of the beauty that defines the African woman. These, he does exceptionally well in a melodious voice that truly mesmerizes the heart and captures the soul. Using a rare musical technique (falsetto), Maxxiebaby re-defines his sound and distinctively differentiates his Afro-fusion musicality from others in the industry. For Maxxiebaby, he acknowledges that although words are free, they have creative power and how he uses them in his music, exhibits the value he places on the power of words. Finally, Maxxiebaby has a striking resemblance with the voice of early Adekunle Gold, who coincidentally happens to be one of his musical mentors. Like Adekunle Gold, there is no doubt that Maxxiebaby will exceed already gained grounds in the Nigerian music industry. Matshona Dhliwayo says “a star does not compete with other stars around it, it just shines”. Meet Maxxiebaby, the “Next Big Thing” in the Afro-fusion musical genre who, as a star, is not in competition with any other artist in the industry.
