The senator representing Bauchi North Senatorial District, Adamu Bulkachuwa has been suspended over alleged absenteeism and non performance since he was elected. Senator Bulkachuwa was suspended by the executive of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kafin Kuka, Kofar Gabas ward of Katagum Local Government Area of Bauchi State on Monday. Addressing Journalists at the party’s Bauchi North Zonal Secretariat in Azare, the APC ward chairman Sa’adu Muhammed alleged that the senator has deserted the party and the constituents since he was inaugurated as member of the National Assembly. According to him, Bulkachuwa never deemed it fit to visit his people to commiserate with them on the outbreak of coronavirus, mass deaths or give any donation. “The essence of democracy is primarily to present and safeguard the interest of the populace. A representative, most importantly should uphold the interest of the people he represents above his personal ones. If he cannot afford to do that, he is not worth given the mandate. “The demand and aspiration, pain and agony, needs and wants of the people of Katagum senatorial constituency is pitiable because of the senator’s gross misconduct and failure to table it where it matters most that is at the senate chamber. “Senator Bulkachuwa has disappeared into thin air, evidently deserted his constituency for over six months now, no iconic presence or project from him is sighted in his constituency all this while,” he decried. The party alleged that Senator Bulkachuwa has not employed any legislative aide despite the fact that every serving senator is empowered to employ five personal staff. They noted that, his actions has thereby left his teeming supporters jobless.
