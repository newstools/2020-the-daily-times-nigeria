Ukraine’s military has been fighting Russian-supported rebel groups in eastern Ukraine, near the Russian border, for more than six years. According to estimates by the United Nations, more than 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict. The conflict erupted after Kiev ousted its pro-Russian president in early 2014 in a political shift towards the West. Russia, which has represented the rebels at international peace talks, has repeatedly denied allegations of direct involvement in the conflict. (dpa/NAN)
