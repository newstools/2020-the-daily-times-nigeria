Namibia says it will roll out a programme that will provide laptops and internet access to 32,000 students in tertiary institutions to enable them to learn remotely amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Minister of Higher Education, Training and Innovation, Itah Kandji-Murangi, disclosed this on Monday. Tanzanian president says economy is more important than threat posed by coronavirus Kandji-Murangi said the programme would be implemented with the support of internet service providers and information technology firms. She said Universities in Namibia would not open for face-to-face learning until Aug. 3. “The challenge with most universities is that they have to accommodate more than 200 students per lecture which makes it difficult to adhere to social distancing guidelines,” she said. “Each student will receive a modem with a maximum of 10 gigabytes of data to go online for schooling,” the minister said. According to her, all the devices will be provided in June. (dpa/NAN)
