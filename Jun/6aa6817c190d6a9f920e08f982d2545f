Nigeria popular disk jockey and project fame Africa winner, DJ Switch has come out to tell her story of how one of her trusted uncles had his way with her when she was still a kid. The worst part of this is that the uncle is also a catholic priest and had threatened her if she came out with the story. Dj Siwtch has lived her life and is finally ready to tell her story. I hadn’t posted about this in particular cus it was hard for me personally but I must say my story and be free of it! When people say “what did she wear?” “Where did she go?” “Why was she alone”? I curse those people! I’ve never told this story outside only 2 people, my immediate elder brother Emma n my sis Lola! I was a child, about 11years old when my uncle, as in real life relative uncle would forcefully touch me and threaten me on top that he would not bless me if I tell my parents, now here’s the shocker. He was a priest! His name is Basil. I’m sure some of my family members will be shocked when they see this. As a kid, my clothing, being alone or with family, friends or playing outside should have never been a curse but just what a kid does. Every man/woman in this world was born of a woman, a mother, sister, daughter… And I tell u, any woman who is violated against her will can and should lay a curse on the generation of the rapist! A child molester! A pervert!
