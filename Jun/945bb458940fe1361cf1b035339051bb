Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara says democracy is meaningless without the people who should be the centre piece of policies of any government. AbdulRazaq made this known on Friday in Ilorin in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Rafiu Ajakaye, to commemorate the 2020 Democracy Day celebration. I warned, democracy will only return to Nigeria when Buhari leaves office – Fayose “My understanding of democracy is that the people we govern are the most important stakeholders in everything we do. Every other thing is secondary. “Democracy is meaningless if the people are not the centre piece of our policies,” AbdulRazaq added. The governor said that his administration was committed to fairness and justice to all in the spirit of democracy. According to him, democracy will be meaningless where the interest of the majority was sacrificed for sectional interest. “I join millions of our compatriots, especially Mr President, to celebrate our Democracy Day. “My profound respects go to all the heroes and heroines of our democracy, dead or alive, who paid huge sacrifices for their democratic beliefs,” the governor said. AbdulRazaq also commended the people of the state at home and in the Diaspora, who contributed to the victory recorded by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 polls. He declared that the focus of his administration has been to reward the people by providing dividends of democracy to every segment of the state. “As we commemorate the 21st anniversary of this republic, my team and I rededicate ourselves to developing our state and serving only the interests of the people. “We are also committed to respecting people’s rights to their personal liberty, human dignity, association, and their rights to hold opinion within the limits of the law. “We will also cater for all legitimate demands, partisan or otherwise, that are not antithetical to democratic principles or cross the lines of decency,” he said.
