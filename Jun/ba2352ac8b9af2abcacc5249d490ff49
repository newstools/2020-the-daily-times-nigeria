The Kaduna State Government says it has imposed a 24-hour curfew in Atyap Chiefdom of Zangon Kataf Local Government and Chawai Chiefdom in Kauru Local Government, with immediate effect. Mr Samuel Aruwan, the Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs disclosed this in a statement on Thursday in Kaduna. Aruwan said the 24-hour curfew was due to the inability of community leaders in the area to resolve the issue that led to clash between the villages over farmland. “Security agencies are containing the tensions arising from a clash last week over a farmland in Zangon-Kataf that community leaders tried to resolve but which seems to have escalated.”
