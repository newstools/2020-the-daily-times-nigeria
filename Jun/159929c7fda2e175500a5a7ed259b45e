The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State has said that the exit of the State Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, from the ruling party to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was regrettable. Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Mr. Alex Kalejaye, stated this in Akure while reacting to the official defection of Mr. Ajayi to the opposition party with some of his diehard supporters. He explained that the state APC has received the “written letter” of the deputy governor to leave the ruling party after he resigned at his ward 2, Apoi kingdom in Kiribo, on Sunday. Kalejaye said the deputy governor shouldn’t have taken the decision to abandon the party after several efforts by  APC leaders and traditional rulers intervention to stop his migration. “The State Secretariat of the party in Ondo State has received a written decision of the Deputy Governor, Hon. Alfred Agboola Ajayi, from the party, with mixed feelings. “The party views the development as worrisome and unfortunate that the journey commenced in one accord a few years back could go awry this soon. “We wished Ajayi had not taken this decision, after series of efforts and attempts by royal fathers and party leaders from within and outside the state to forestall this migration.” The APC spokesperson added that it would be willing to accommodate Mr. Ajayi and his supporters back if they wish to retrace their steps to the party and reunite with governor Rotimi Akeredolu whom they both ran together in 2016 on the same platform. While noting that the State Working Committee of the party would ensure it strengthens his fold ahead of the governorship election, Mr. Kalejaye said it would be good for the Deputy Governor to also resign his position and face his new political journey in the PDP. Ajayi who defected to the PDP following the frosty relationship between him and Governor Akeredolu has also promised to contest the October 10 governorship election.
