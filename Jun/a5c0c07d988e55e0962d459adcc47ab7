The former Vice President of Nigeria, Alhaji  Atiku Abubakar  has warned that ‘a hungry nation is a troubled nation’ just as he called on the Federal Government to tackle the security challenges farmers in the northern part of the Nigeria are facing. Atiku lamented that denying the people the freedom to farm in a rainy season as we are experiencing now, is the greatest disservice to the region and by extension, the whole country. Atiku on his Facebook page said: ‘Farming is not just an occupation for the majority of the people of Nigeria, but also, the lifeblood of the North. Northern Nigeria is synonymous to agriculture. Don’t reopen schools now, ASUU President urges govt However, the insecurity the region is battling with at the moment is hampering any meaningful farming activities. As someone engaged in agriculture myself and whose company is dependent on products from farmers, I know that denying the people the freedom to farm in a rainy season as we are experiencing now, is the greatest disservice to the region and by extension, the whole country. Hence, I urge the Federal Government in collaboration with the governments of the states in the region to take the security challenges seriously, because, failure to overcome this will be problematic for the whole country. A hungry nation is a troubled nation. While we hope and pray for our security agents to overcome these challenges, citizens should organise themselves and also be vigilant in detecting the movements of criminal elements in their areas. Hard times don’t last forever. Together, we shall overcome our challenges. – AA
