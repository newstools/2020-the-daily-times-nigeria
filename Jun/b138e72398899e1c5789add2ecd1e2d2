The Kwara government has attributed the regular supply of water to the people of the state within the last few months to the massive rehabilitation of major dams and waterworks. The Kwara Commissioner for Water Resources, Hajia Arinola Lawal,said in Ilorin on Wednesday that the administration at its inception in 2019 had made tackling the perennial water scarcity in the state  one of its priorities.

To achieve and maintain the consistency in the supply of water, the commissioner, who did not cite figures, said a lot of money was pumped into the rehabilitation of the waterworks. “What we met on ground was nothing to write home about. Most of our waterworks were not functioning. “Some had been vandalised in the past five to eight years. The ones that were even functioning on our arrival lacked the needed chemicals, electricity and adequate maintenance. “This is one of the things that our government has been able to do and achieve in a very short period of time,” Lawal said.
