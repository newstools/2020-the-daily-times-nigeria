Ifeajika said both officials showed mild symptoms of the virus and consequently, subjected themselves to testing. He said that both men had been moved to an isolation centre and were stable, and responding to treatment. The chief press secretary called on residents of the state to adhere strictly to the COVID-19 protocols as anyone, irrespective of status could contract the virus. “Let me advise all residents to as a matter of top priority always obey the COVID-19 protocols which have been in public domain, so as to curb further spread of the pandemic. “The fresh cases in our hands in the state further testify to the fact that COVID-19 is not a scam. “It is real and people should take the issues of the virus and personal hygiene seriously. “COVID-19 is not a death sentence; so, when you begin to feel unwell, reach out to approved government hospitals for appropriate tests to be carried out. “We can save ourselves and others from this virus if we obey all the protocols of wearing face masks, regular washing of hands in running water, use of alcohol-based sanitiser and maintaining physical-distancing while congregating in any form. “All our hospitals and isolation centres across the state are on 24- hour alert to receive any case(s) of the coronavirus or other health challenges,” he said.
