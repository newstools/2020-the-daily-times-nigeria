Upper Area Court in Makurdi, Benue State has dissolved the marriage between Jennifer and Joseph Ojeka due to lack of sex. The petitioner, had earlier alleged her husband for starving her with sex and for always beating her at every little provocation. Jennifer lamented the act of her husband and claimed that all efforts made by her to rescue the marriage have proved futile. In her words she said, “I have tried everything possible to make the marriage work but all efforts failed”. The marriage between the duo, which occured in 2012 under the the Calabar Marriage Law and Custom, was then dissolved by the judge, Ms. Rose Iyorshe, on Wednesday, who claimed that evidences presented to the court by Ojeka shows that the marriage is completely shattered. The petitionee, who didn’t show up at the court however sent his account number to the court for the petitioner to pay back the bride price he paid when they got married, and the judge ordered the petitioner to do so.
