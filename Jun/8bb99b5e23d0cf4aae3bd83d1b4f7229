The Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland and coordinator of the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC), Iba Gani Abiodun Adams, has described the annulment of June 12, 1993 presidential election as one of the most defining moments in Nigeria’s political history. Expressing joy that part of the dreams of the OPC, under his leadership have been realised with the celebration of June 12 as the nation’s Democracy Day, Adams in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Aderemi, however regretted that despite the sacrifices of the activists and pro-democracy groups, a lot needed to be done for democracy to take firmer roots in the country. Adams said the country would get better with better practice of true federalism, adding that federating states should be geared towards achieving the best for the people at the grassroots. He said this could be achieved through healthy competition among the federating units, including the government at the centre, states and local councils. Adams noted that it was good that democracy is evolving, calling for more attention to be paid to deepening democratic norms. “The struggle for the actualisation of the June 12 mandate given freely to the late MKO Abiola in a free and fair election then was a long and hard battle.

Adams further stressed that the outbreak of Covid-19 had restrained OPC from celebrating the annual June 12 symposium, adding that the group remained the only formidable group that had been celebrating the June 12 anniversary since 2001. “To the glory of God, OPC has been a vocal voice requesting for the authentication of June 12 as the official Democracy Day. “So, whether our effort is being recognised today or not, it is on record that we are part of the success stories of this democracy,” Adams added.
