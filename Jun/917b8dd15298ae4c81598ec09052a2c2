A group known as Edo State Focus Group (ESFG) has called on people of the state both at home and abroad to unite and rescue the state from some persons it described as “disgruntled and unscrupulous politicians ravaging destiny of the state,” particularly as it concerns the forthcoming governorship election. National Coordinator of the group, Hope Hoppy Ebbih, in a speech delivered over the weekend in Benin City, the state capital noted that from 1999 when democracy started, and from PDP to APC, all those who ruled the state did that for their selfish interest and not interest of the electorates. “Since the enthronement of democratic rule in 1999, the likes of Mr. Luck Igbinedion (PDP); Professor Osereimhen Osunbor (PDP); Comrade Adams Oshiomhole (APC); and Mr. Godwin Obaseki (APC), had ruled the state for their selfish interest. They had amassed wealth to the detriment of the citizens of Edo State,” he added. According to the Coordinator, the group was birthed to ensure credibility in the forthcoming electoral process and beyond, just as he added that the group is also poised to protecting character and status of electorates in the state. Ebbih added that the group, as a non-political and non partisan, is committed to holding public office holders responsive to the needs and yearnings of the electorates in the state.
