For over an hour, residents of Jalingo, Taraba State, have been struggling to save a military man from committing suicide. The soldier, whose name is given as Ali, has climbed the Welcome to Taraba Roadblock Tower -over 24fts high, and is threatening to jump down. Three to die by hanging in Rivers for killing Soboma George-Court Ali who spoke to the Nation in Hausa and pidgin, said, “I want to die. Allow me to jump down and die.” But the youth who have gathered there are begging him: “Please do not jump. We don’t want you to die.” Ali is seen on the high altitude Tower, attempting severally to jump down, but the people are trying to make sure they save him if he jumps. But they say they prefer he changes his mind and does not jump. Witnesses said the soldier’s behaviour attracted their attention when they spotted him on top of the tower pulling and throwing down the items of clothing on him. “We noticed someone climbing the place and pulling off his clothes. We got there to discover he is someone we know. He was left with under pant and an inner vest and poised to jump. We went close and began to beg him,” an eyewitness said. A close look reveals he has an injury on his left kneecap, which he bandaged. A source disclosed that  that Ali has mental illness and has been relieved of his job, of recent. “He is an ex-soldier, fond of riding military motorbikes in town. He was sacked from the army when it was discovered he is mentally ill,” another source said.
