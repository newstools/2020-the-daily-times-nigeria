The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has  said that it is “familiar with grisly details of Hushpuppi‘s money laundering transactions, involving many high-profile cyber criminals facing trial in Nigeria.” The EFCC also said that  Ramoni Igbalode, popularly known as Ray Hushpuppi, who was recently arrested in Dubai is “Nigeria’s most-wanted hacker.” Hushpuppi was arrested in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over fraud-related allegations involving the International Police (Interpol) and Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI). Dele Oyewale, EFCC spokesperson on Thursday,said that the commission is now tracking other fraudsters directly involved with the internet personality, adding that “he has a case to answer.” “The EFCC is familiar with grisly details of his money laundering transactions, involving many high-profile cybercriminals facing trial in Nigeria,” “The Commission is engaging with the FBI in tracking victims of his fraudulent transactions and other fraudsters having direct involvement with him. Local cybercriminals with money laundering networks with him are also being investigated.” The commission added that the Instagram celebrity was arrested on June 10 “in connection with $35million ventilator scam.” Hushpuppi is known for his luxury lifestyle, which sees him flaunt expensive vehicles, dine with celebrities, and spread pictures of his glamorous home’s state-of-the-art furniture on social media. In 2019, he made headlines after he claimed that his driver earned as much a non-fraudulent commissioner in Nigeria. Hushpuppi’s case comes months after the anti-graft agency docked Mompha, another wealthy internet personality, over alleged N32.9 billion money laundering. It also comes at about the same time when Cubana Chief Priest, a nightlife promoter, was detained by the police over alleged misuse of escorts and unexplained wealth.
