The Federal Government prohibited street trading and hawking while announcing the second phase of the eased lockdown. The National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Sani Aliyu, stated this on Monday while announcing new guidelines during a briefing in Abuja. He said, “In terms of general movements, persons may go out for work, go out to buy necessary foods and for exercise, provided they abide by the curfew hours. Movement between local government areas is strongly discouraged unless for critical reasons such as health care and work. “I will like to emphasise that it is still safer to stay at home and avoid crowds. The pandemic is not over in this country and the relaxation of some of the rules does not mean that it is safer to go out. If you do not need to go out, please continue to stay at home. “Hawking and street trading is also prohibited and we will be looking into this in greater detail with state authorities.” “With interstate travels, movement across state boundaries remains restricted other than the free movement of goods and essential travels. Security services are requested to please cooperate with members of the public and ensure that goods are provided with free passage, as this particular phase is directed at ensuring the economy starts moving again. “With intrastate travel, we will implement new travel processes for areas of the country with high-burden local government areas, and this will be restricted to essential travels.”
