According to reports, Joe Hart will not be offered a short-term contract extension at Burnley and he will leave the club on June 30. The 33-year-old joined the Clarets from Manchester City for £3.5m in 2018, but he has struggled for game time at the club, with Nick Pope being favored as the number one. He lost his place after a 5-1 home defeat by Everton in December of that same year and has made only three appearances since, all in cup games. Hart’s career has suffered a major downturn since he was an integral part of two City title-winning squads in 2012 and 2014, winning the Premier League’s Golden Glove prize on four occasions and earning 75 England caps. When Pep Guardiola took over at City, he made it clear that he will not be using Hart between the posts, and it forced the goalkeeper to leave the club. Hart, who may be on the bench for Monday’s trip to his former club City, had unsuccessful loan spells with Torino and West Ham before joining Burnley.
