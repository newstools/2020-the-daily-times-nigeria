Chelsea women’s football team will donate their title prize money to Refuge as part of their ongoing campaign of helping women and children experiencing domestic abuse. The club announced this on Wednesday, having been awarded the title on Friday following a resolution meeting to determine the fate of the 2019/20 season. The prize for winning the Super League is £100,000, which will now go a long way in helping those suffering from domestic abuse during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Chelsea Women coach Emma Hayes expressed his pleasure in being part of those at the forefront of promoting the club’s support for Refuge. “It’s a charity that’s close to the hearts and minds of the Women’s team, and is very important to our owner Mr Abramovich and everyone at the club,” Hayes confirmed. “It makes me proud our club is supporting those less fortunate in times of need,” Adding: “Up until now our involvement was about supporting the campaign publicly with a call to action but we all wanted to do more than that and if donating our prize money can ease some of the concerns and worries people have then it’s the least we can do,” The club was awarded the title despite being second behind Manchester City after the clubs agreed to use the points-per-game basis to determine the winner and teams to be relegated. The club enjoyed a hugely impressive campaign and remained unbeaten throughout the season.
