*Says, it will reduce   impact of food shortages, hunger The Global Initiative for Food Security and Ecosystem Preservation (GIFSEP), has called on Nigerians to plant more trees and establish home gardens during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. GISEP  Executive Director, Mr David Michael Terungwa in a statement made available to the Daily Times stated that the practice would reduce the problem of food shortages and hunger during and after the pandemic.While expressing concern over the rise in food insecurity during the current COVID-19 pandemic, Terungwa explained that homestead gardening is a short and long term intervention to boast food and vegetable production in communities and households.He said, “We must therefore collectively act now not just with our brains but with our hands to mitigate the impact of food shortages and hunger to defeat the hunger virus. “We urge people who have spaces in and around their homes to grow a combination of medicinal plants and herbs as base and then grow vegetables and legumes. Eg pumpkin, spinach, bitter leaf, curry, water leaf, jute leaves, clove, eggplant, okra, tomatoes, pepper among others.“On the other hand we also encourage people to plant Trees in their homes, depending on the available space.“We urge people to plant a fruit and an indigenous tree. Examples of some of the Trees include, moringa, citrus, mango, pear, coconut, guava, pawpaw etc”.He called on parents to make good use of the lock down opportunity  by engaging their children  in home gardening and tree planting activities.  “Now is the time to teach our children the miracle of life by engaging them in home gardening and tree planting activities.” I urged parents to seize the opportunity of this lock down. This is the best time to establish a garden and plant a tree in your home.“GIFSEP will offer free guide to individuals, volunteers and households who wish to establish home gardens and plant trees”, he added.
