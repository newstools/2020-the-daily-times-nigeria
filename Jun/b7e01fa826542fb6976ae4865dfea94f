The Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) is set to revamp the regulatory framework for collective management of copyright in the country. The move, the commission says, is to ensure transparency and accountability in the collection and distribution of royalties, in the interest of the right owners. The Director-General of NCC, John Asein made the declaration at a webinar marking the World Music Day on Sunday, June 21. Asein pointed out that the real success of a CMO is measured by the effectiveness of its collection and distribution function, verifiable through the simple rules of good governance, responsible leadership, efficiency, accountability, and transparency. He also emphasized the need for copyright administrators to change the way rights are managed in order to ensure that the right owners, and not managers, are the ones enriched. “The CMOS should assist right owners to earn every naira due to them through the title-specific distribution of royalties, particularly in the field of music and not force them to take less under the guise of the general distribution of royalties,” the DG said. Explaining the possibility of this with the deployment of appropriate technology, Asein enjoined CMOs “to embrace new business models and leverage on available technological solutions that would help them operate more efficiently and deliver on their primary mandate for the benefit of their members.”
