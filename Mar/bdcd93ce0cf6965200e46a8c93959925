Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State, has charged the National Youth Service Corps Members, (NYSC), to stop seeking for white collar jobs. “The era of desperately seeking white collar jobs is over. You must therefore brace up for the daunting challenges ahead and create opportunities rather than seeking for them”. Four corps members get merit award in Niger Lalong said corpers should take advantage of skills acquired during service year, to build a world of entrepreneurship and become employers of labour. “The experience you have gathered during the service year most especially in the area of skill acquisition and entrepreneurial development should be used optimally for your own good and to the overall development of our dear country”. The Governor stated this on Thursday during the passing out parade of the 2019 Batch A Corps Members deployed to Plateau State. “Let diligence be your passion and you will surely excel at any enterprise you embark upon, because it is far better to strive to become employers of labour and wealth creators than job seekers”, Lalong said. Earlier, the NYSC State Coordinator, Mrs Caroline Embu, said she is confident that the corps members will put to work skills acquired during their service year. “I am confident that you will bring to bear the cumulative experience of your exposure and trainings achieved, especially the skills acquisition and entrepreneurship development in your dealing as you enter the next phase of your journey to greatness. “As operators of the NYSC Scheme and foster parents of the corps members, we have been charged with the responsibility of nurturing them to contribute to the growth of the national economy”, Embu said.
