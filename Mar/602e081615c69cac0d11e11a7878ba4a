World Health Organization officials have said that there is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. According to  CNN  WHO officials recommend that people should not wear face masks unless they are sick with Covid-19 or caring for someone who is sick. Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday said “There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly,” “There also is the issue that we have a massive global shortage,” . “Right now the people most at risk from this virus are frontline health workers who are exposed to the virus every second of every day. The thought of them not having masks is horrific.” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, an infectious disease epidemiologist with the WHO, also said at Monday’s briefing that it is important “we prioritize the use of masks for those who need it most,” which would be frontline health care workers.
