President Donald Trump announced late Friday that he was replacing his acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, with Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a shake-up in the top echelons of the West Wing just as the President confronts a growing public health crisis and girds for reelection. Meadows, who had previously announced he was leaving Congress, will become Trump’s fourth chief of staff in a little more than three years in office. In a tweet, Trump did not denote him “acting,” a designation Mulvaney never graduated from in the turbulent 14 months he spent in the job.

I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,” Trump tweeted Friday just after arriving at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida
