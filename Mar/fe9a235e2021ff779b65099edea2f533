A  chieftain of the Southern Youths Development Forum and a cleric, Pastor  Bassey James has commended the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu  Buhari, Mr. Abba Kyari for his exemplary management of the office of the  President, describing him as a man with great experience. James  said he was thrilled with the Chief of Staff because of the maturity  that he brought into managing the office of the President and not  allowing side comments by the many opposition figures who are intent on  rubbishing the office of the President and discrediting him get to him.

 noted that Kyari’s extensive experience in the different offices he has
 held has really prepared him for his current position and he is 
bringing all of that experience to bear on the job by bringing sanity 
around the President. He added, “What the Chief of Staff is doing 
in the office of the President is really encouraging, he has brought his
 huge experience to bear on his current job and he is managing the 
office of the President with so much expertise. “If you look at 
what some persons are doing, disparaging the office of the President at 
every given opportunity, you will agree with me that he has been able to
 restrain the staff of the Presidency from going dirty like many 
opposition figures would have love them to. “While he has remained
 very much at the background as expected of a man holding such office, 
he has still managed to keep staff of the office in check so that they 
won’t embarrass the President and makes the great principles who stands 
for come to naught. “Sincerely every President needs a man like 
Abba Kyari to manage his office to stop over ambitious aides from 
rubbishing the image of the President and making nonsense of the 
principles he is known for and has stood for over the years.” While
 advising aides of other top political office holders to learn from 
Kyari on managing the image and office of their principal, James urged 
Kyari to see how he can pass his experience to others who may aspire to 
hold such positions in future, on effective management of their 
principal and keeping everyone in his place.
