U.S. rocker Jon Bon Jovi teamed up with Britain’s Prince Harry and a military choir to release the single “Unbroken” on Friday to raise awareness of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The prince turned up to watch the singer and the Invictus Games Choir record the track at London’s Abbey Road Studios last month in one of his last engagements as a senior member of the royal family. “He was wonderful when he came to see us. He gave us all a big hug,” said Caroline Beazley, a member of the choir who was shot while serving with Britain’s armed forces in Belfast in 1994.

The singer’s parents both served in the U.S. Marine Corps while Harry served in the British military. (Reuters)
