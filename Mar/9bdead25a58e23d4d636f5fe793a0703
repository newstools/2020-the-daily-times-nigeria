At one stage, I was the first understudy behind Mertesacker and Koscielny but they then bought Gabriel Paulista in January,” he said. “Arsene Wenger was very honest with me in that he said he wanted me to stay and develop but he couldn’t offer me first-team football at that point.” The defender, who currently plays for Championship side West Brom made his senior debut for Nigeria in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Seychelles in 2018.
