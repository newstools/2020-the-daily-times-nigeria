Speaker of the Kogi state House of Assembly, Matthew Kolawole, has refuted insinuations that he is nursing ambition to contest the 2023 governorship election in the state. Kolawole, who made the rebuttal while addressing his statutory aides on Thursday in Lokoja, said it is against insinuations that he was supporting some local government council chairmanship aspirants in view of 2023. He stated that he has not shown any sign of aspiration to the coveted seat to anyone and has never given it a thought. “I have just spent eight months out of 48 months mandate given to me by the good people of Kabba-Bunu State Constituency, how come some are talking of 2023 that is basically in the hands of God. “For me, I have not discussed 2023 aspirations with anyone, neither have I signified any intention. It is only God that determines the future. I only pray that God should give me a successful tenure,” he said. Kolawole charged the statutory aides to be loyal and guard against idle words, indiscipline, indolence, laziness and misinformation stressing that loyalty to the present administration was the key.
