Since the check out of ‘Micherry’ from the Ultimate Love Pad, tension and anxiety has increased in the house with the game change; hence in its fourth week, seven couples have been nominated for possible check-out with at least one couple checking out of the show this weekend. After the nominations, only Iyke Resa and David Presh are safe from this week’s eviction; however as the rule of the game, Aunty picked two couples ‘JayKech and ObiEbi’ who carried out a task to save themselves from eviction by visiting the Bethesda Home for the blind where they taught students and cooked for them respectively.
