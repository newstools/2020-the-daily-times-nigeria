The International Monetary Fund and World Bank on 
Wednesday called for governments to put a hold on debt payments from the
 world’s poorest nations so they can battle the coronavirus pandemic. “The
 World Bank Group and the IMF believe it is imperative at this moment to
 provide a global sense of relief for developing countries as well as a 
strong signal to financial markets,” the Washington-based development 
lenders said in a joint statement. The move aims to help countries
 that are home to two-thirds of the world’s population living in extreme
 poverty — largely in sub-Saharan Africa — and qualify for the most 
generous, low-cost loans from the International Development Association 
(IDA) financed by wealthier nations. “The coronavirus outbreak is 
likely to have severe economic and social consequences for IDA 
countries” which will face “immediate liquidity needs to tackle 
challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak,” the organization said. The
 IMF and World Bank called on the Group of 20 nations to support the 
initiative for “all official bilateral creditors to suspend debt 
payments from IDA countries that request forbearance.”  In
 addition, the institutions called for an analysis of the financing 
needs these countries will face, and whether their total debt load is 
sustainable. Part of the World Bank, the IDA is one of the largest
 sources of assistance for the world’s 76 poorest countries, providing 
zero or low interest loans spread over 30 years or more, and grants to 
some distressed nations. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, 
IDA commitments totaled $22 billion, of which 36 percent was provided on
 grant terms, according to the World Bank.
