The Oyo state government
says it has earmarked N1 billion for the upgrade of all primary health centres across
the state. Governor Seyi Makinde made the disclosure on Monday during the flag -off of the Free Health Mission in Kishi, headquarters of Irepo Local Government Area of Oyo state. What Sanwo-Olu told Buhari on Sunday’s Lagos explosion Gov. Makinde said
that he has directed council chairmen to spend 7.5 per cent of their allocation
on primary health care centres as a way of promoting good health care service
delivery. He asserted that
the role of government is to steer the overall health care development,
designing health care policies and programme, positing further that it is the
duty of government to secure essential public health functions and regulating
the delivery of health care services. The governor stated
that the decay in the health sector over the last few decades “have come to us
as a recurring decimal which has to be confronted holistically and at all
fronts.” According to him,
the upgrading the primary health care delivery would allow citizens of the
state to have high standards of living while mortality and morbidity rate would
be kept low. He said health care
service in the state is undergoing a lot of reformation and that the free
health mission is aimed at the less privileged at the grassroots who don’t have
money to access treatment. However, Gov.
Makinde said the exercise, which would be carried out across the local
government areas for the benefits of the people, is not a remedy to the
identified gaps in health care service delivery. “But, it only
serves as a stop-gap measure which will give the necessary time for other plans
in the health sector to mature. Those with diabetes and high blood pressure
will be treated and get free drugs,” he added. Traditional ruler
of Kishi, Oba Lawal Arowoduye, commended the governor for the free health care
mission and urged him to sustain the good work.
