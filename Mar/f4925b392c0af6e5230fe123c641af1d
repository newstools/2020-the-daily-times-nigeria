workers in the state to stay at home for two weeks to curtail the spread of
COVID-19 in the state. “I wish to announce
that the Anambra state House of Assembly has proceeded on indefinite adjournment
due to the outbreak of the coronavirus in the country. “Lawmakers will
however, embark on sensitisation tour of their various constituencies to
