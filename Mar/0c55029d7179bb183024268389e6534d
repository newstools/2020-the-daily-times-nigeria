Five guns which were used in “James Bond” movies, including the last weapon brandished by actor Roger Moore while playing 007, have been stolen from a house in north London by suspects with Eastern European accents, British police said on Friday. The deactivated weapons, which police said were believed to be worth more than 100,000 pounds ($122,000), were taken in the theft on Monday night from the house in Enfield. The stolen guns included a Beretta ‘Cheetah’ pistol which appeared in the “Die Another Day” film; a Beretta ‘Tomcat’ pistol with a laser/silencer attachment and a Llama 22 which were also used in that same film. The others were a Walther PPK from “A View To A Kill” and a Revolver Smith and Weston 44 Magnum from “Live and Let Die”.

The Walther PPK was the last gun used by Roger Moore in ‘A View to a Kill’.” Police said neighbors had disturbed the three burglars who drove away in a silver vehicle. (Reuters)
