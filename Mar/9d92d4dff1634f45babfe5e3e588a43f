Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state says he is in self-isolation as a precautionary measure against the spread of the coronavirus. Gov. Fayemi, who is
also the chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum, made this known on
Wednesday in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Olayinka
Oyebode, in Ado-Ekiti. The governor in the
statement, said his going into self-isolation, should not be misconstrued to
mean that he already has the COVID-19 disease. “There is no cause
for alarm. I just took this step as a normal precautionary measure. I have gone
in contact with those suspected to be having the case of COVID-19 and I
felt I have to do this to help the situation. “With the
circumstance we find ourselves today, every citizen must engage in personal
hygiene and take actions that can help us overcome this challenge and that is
exactly what I have done,” he said. Gov. Fayemi
therefore, urged Ekiti residents not to panic over the development, adding
further that “I took the precautionary measures in the best interest of all and
to prevent the spread of the disease.” He urged Ekiti
citizens to abide by his directives on social distancing and obey fully the
restriction of gathering to only 20 people and hand washing to prevent the
spread of the disease. Gov. Fayemi had
earlier announced his self-isolation on his tweeter handle, following unfolding
revelations that some top presidential aides and governors, whom he had
contacts with had tested positive to the virus.
