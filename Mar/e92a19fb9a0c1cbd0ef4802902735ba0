the chief judge of the High Court, Federal Capital Territory, said the inmates
were released based on mandate given to the committee. He said the
pardon was based on grounds of ill -health and those who were convicted of
minor offences with option of fines but were unable to pay, adding that the
state government has magnanimously agreed to settle the fines on behalf of the
convicted inmates and set them free. “We have in our
mandate to look at those who have over stayed the sentence year, the aged, ill
health and those who committed minor offences and have options of fines but
could not pay. “The total inmates
released are 13 from the correctional centre, out of this, 11 of them had
their option of fine paid.
Two were released on grounds of ill health. “I want to commend
the comptroller for this show of diligence and competence in doing the job,”
Bello said. The chairman
advised the released inmates to be of good conduct, not to involve in crimes
that would likely bring them back to the correctional centre and urged them to
associate with people of good character to be better citizens for themselves
and the country. He commended the
comptroller for the cleanliness and good environment of the centre.
