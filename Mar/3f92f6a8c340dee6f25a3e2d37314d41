outflows intensify, the country’s foreign exchange reserves declined by $61.70
million in its week-till-date (WtD) performance to $36.16 billion (March 12,
2020), as the CBN maintained its support for the currency via its weekly FX
interventions; $210.00 million was sold across the different segments of the FX
market – $100.00 million to the Wholesale segment, $55.00 million to the SMEs
segment, and $55.00 million to the Invisibles segment. “Looking ahead,
we expect the foreign reserves to support the CBN’s currency defence over
H1-20. Further out, the blend of tighter cash inflows, faster pace of capital
repatriation and the possible resurgence of speculative attacks on the naira will
force the CBN to throw in the towel in our opinion,” analysts at Cordos capital
said. Activities in
the treasury bills market were bearish as foreign investors sold off Open
Market Operation (OMO) bills on coronavirus fears and the crash in oil prices. Consequently,
the average yield across instruments expanded by 242basis points to 12.6 per
cent. The average
yield in the OMO segment of the market expanded by 370basis points to 16.6 per
cent while the average yield in the NTB secondary market contracted by 13bps to
close at 3.9 per cent. Last week’s NTB
the ary auction, the CBN fully allotted N86.30 billion worth of bills – N1.80
billion of the 91-day, N14.00 billion of the 182-day and N70.50 billion of the
364-day – at lower stop rates of 2.49per cent (previously three per cent),
3.78per cent (previously four per cent), and 5.30per cent (previously 5.70per
cent).

“We expect
foreign investor led-selloffs to persist in the OMO secondary market amidst
continued Coronavirus worries and lower oil prices. At the NTB PMA next week,
the CBN is expected to offer NGN47.56 billion worth of instruments to
investors,” analysts at Cordros capital added.
