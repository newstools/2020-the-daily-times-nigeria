The Academic Staff of Universities Union (ASUU) has declared an indefinite strike after the expiration of its two-weeks warning strike. The National president of the union, Biodun Ogunyemi, announced the strike at a press conference in Abuja on Monday. I shook hands with Atiku Abubakar’s son, I am going on self- quarantine – Bauchi State governor “The union has decided to embark on total and indefinite strike from Monday 23,2020, ” he said. He said the union rejects the use of force to enrol on Integrated Payroll and Personal Information System (IPPIS). The National Universities Commission ordered universities across the country to close for a month, beginning from March 23, due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Recall the union commenced its warning strike on March 9, 2020. Since the commencement of the strike, the government met with the union twice. ASUU is embarking on the strike over the non-payment of salaries of their members who failed to enrol into the federal government’s IPPIS, a payroll software mandated for all public officials.
