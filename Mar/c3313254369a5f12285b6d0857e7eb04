The Managing
Director/Chief Executive Officer of Lagos Bus Services Limited (LBSL), Mr Idowu
Oguntona, has scored high the active involvement of women in transportation business. In a recent interview, Oguntona said 20 of its current 400
drivers are female, and its target is to make women account for 10 per cent of
its drivers in future. LBSL runs high-capacity Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) buses that ply
various routes in the state. “Currently, we have 20 female captains within our
employment; our target is to have about 10 per cent of our drivers as female,”
Oguntona said. He said that in terms of training, the company had a very
robust training plan for its drivers before they joined the service. “This is about six weeks training in the classroom and
outside the classroom within our training school. “Beyond that, we always retrain from time to time; we have a quarterly training for all our drivers.’’ Imo: Supreme Court verdict excites APC Chairman, Oshiomhole According to him, the firm has about 400 drivers in its
employment driving about 215 Marcopolo high-capacity buses in the state. He expressed optimism that services between Iyana-Ipaja and
Oshodi would commence soon. “I am sure that service is going to commence very soon. The
governor (Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu) did speak to that as well. I believe the
infrastructure, the BRT lane, is near completion right now. “Once that is done, I am sure LAMATA will licence an
operator to provide service on the corridor. “So, the teeming commuters in that axis should be patient,
the service will come there very soon. I am sure LAMATA is looking actively to
ensure that,’’ he said.
