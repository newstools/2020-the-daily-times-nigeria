The House of Assembly member representing Lokoja ll , State
Constituency, in the Kogi State House of Assembly, Honorable Idris Idako has
absolved himself of any complicity  over
the alleged petition forwarded  to the House
of Assembly to remove  Olu Oworo. Idako who was reacting to allegations of being the
mastermind of the petition against the traditional ruler, Olu Oworo , Mallam
Mohammed Adoga Baiyerohi  and the crisis
rocking Oworoland at a press briefing in Lokoja, explained that he would never
be a party to such obnoxious move, but rather support what is right for his
people who had voted for him twice to represent them at the Kogi State House of
Assembly . According to him, as representative of his people in the
Kogi State House of Assembly he was mandated by the Constitution of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria to articulate, present bills and motions that may bring
socio-economic development to his constituency as well as bring before the
House complaints and problems that may be inimical to their communities. Idako  added that this
was exactly what he did on 20th February ,2020 when he received the petition on
behalf of the people which addressed to the Speaker and members of the House, noting
that by that singular act, he has not done anything wrong because that is what
the constitution demand from him as their representative in the current
government. The lawmaker also lamented that the traditional ruler had castigated
him in a press release, stressing that he has no option than to defend himself and
expose the traditional ruler’s unholy practices in the district which are very
glaring and known to an average Oworo person. He stressed that the House of Assembly is at liberty to take
appropriate measures to deal with the matter at hand and their recommendation
gets final approval of the state government, saying that it is not for him to
determine the outcome of the petition sent to the house by Iwo Masi ruling
houses. He also alleged that the royal father was partisan, noting
that Mallam Mohammed Adoga Baiyerohi used his exalted position as the
traditional ruler to work against all progressive policies of the government in
the state and worked, supported  the
opposition party in his domain. “The issue of land ownership raised by Olu Oworo and
his foot soldiers did not come to me as surprise, if you could recall on 3rd
January, 2014, Mallam Baiyerohi sued my ancestral community, Isegba Felele Obah
in his dirty attempt for his land grabbing by using falsehood and distortion of
facts claiming that the original 
inhabitant of the land he has in mind to take over  have been wiped out from the surface of the
earth as a result of epidemic  that invaded
the land many years ago,” he stated. The lawmaker posited that the current occupier of Olu Oworo
has initiated crises in various Oworo communities for his selfish interest
which has brought disunity and lack of development to the district, adding that
virtually all communities in Oworo land have been engulfed in one crisis or the
other  to some reasons filed at House of
Assembly by Iwo Masi ruling houses who are demanding for his sack or
dethronement in no distant time.
