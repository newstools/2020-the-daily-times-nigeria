Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, says that the International Women’s Day (IWD) celebration brings to the fore the need to improve access to health services for women globally. Ghebreyesus, in a media briefing on COVID-19 on Friday, said that many women could not access essential health services, and continued to suffer disproportionately from preventable and treatable diseases globally.

Ghebreyesus noted that women are also playing a vital role in the global response to COVID-19, saying WHO is proud to have many amazing women leading its response to the epidemic. He restated WHO’s commitment to promote gender equality everywhere, and especially in the health workforce.
