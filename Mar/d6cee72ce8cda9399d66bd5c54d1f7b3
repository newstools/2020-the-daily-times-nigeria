A group of pensioners from the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) has been formed by retirees of the agency to cater for their well being. Engr Kester Omotayo vice president  General Lagos zone of Federal Ministry told
journalists at the airport in Ikeja that all NAMA Pensioners  operating under the auspices of Nigeria
Union of Pensioners (NUP) has ceased to belong to the Nigeria Union of
Pensioners due to irreconcilable differences. According to Engineer Omotayo, the new
body will be known as Airspace Management Pensioners Association of Nigeria
(AMPAN) stressing that pensioners in NAMA, others in government parastatals and
like-minded esteemed friends and Pensioners from  Private Sectors have fused and formed another
Trade Union body, known as the Federal 
Parastatals and Private Sector Pensioners Association’ of Nigeria
(FEPPPAN) as their new umbrella Omotayo said the monopoly of the NUP has
finally been broken by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment through
the Registrar of Trade Unions, the appropriate government organs authorized to
legalize such bodies. He explained that the NUP in NAMA was not bothered about their welfare but interested in their check-off dues adding that the nonchalant attitude of the NUP led to them forming All Sectors Union (ASU) in NAMA.

attempts by their parent body to stop the formation of the union at the

some pensioners were not being paid as at when due. Omotayo explained that the government was
doing as much as possible for pensioners saying that there was no reason for
