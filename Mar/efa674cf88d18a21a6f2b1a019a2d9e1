The police on Friday arraigned a Badagry chief, Cowel Aivoji (74) and three others before a Lagos Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court for allegedly fighting in public and assault. The police charged Aivoji, Mohammed (61), Mohammed Modawa (43) and Sewedo Hunpevi (26) with three counts of assault, theft and breach of public peace. Prosecution counsel, Clement Okuiomose, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on February10, at about 4 pm at Aivoji Sea Beach along the Seme Border Road in Badagry, Lagos. Okuiomose stated that the fourth defendant (Hunpevi) stole three pieces of coconut fruit, property of the first defendant (Aivoji), alleging that Hunpevi also assaulted the third defendant (Modawa). The prosecution counsel also alleged that the defendants conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace. The offence, he said, contravenes the provisions of Sections 287, 172 and 168 of the Criminal Law of Lagos state, 2015. Magistrate Segun Aka-Bashorun admitted the defendants to bail on self- recognition and thereafter, adjourned the case until April 27, for mention.
