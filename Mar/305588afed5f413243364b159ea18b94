He was captured in the east Libyan city of Derna in late 2018 and transferred to Egypt in May 2019. Ashmawy was convicted on several charges including plotting a 2014 attack that killed 22 military guards, and the attempted assassination of a former interior minister in 2013. Military and civilian courts had sentenced him to death before and after his extradition. Egypt’s military spokesman posted a picture of Ashmawy with a thick beard dressed in orange prison overalls on Twitter. “This morning the death penalty was carried out on the terrorist Hisham al-Ashmawy,’’ he wrote. Local media including the state newspaper al-Ahram as well as security sources had said last week that Ashmawy had been executed, though the news websites later took down their reports. (Reuters/NAN)
