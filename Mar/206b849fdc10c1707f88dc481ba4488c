Nollywood stars, Alex Usifo, Bimbo Akintola , Shushu Abubakar, Okey Uzoeshi, Gloria Anozie-Young, Angel Onyi Unigwe, Nifemi Lawal, Enkay Ogboruche, Aproko Doctor amongst others have featured in a sickle cell themed film, ‘Strain.’ The Verte View production was in conjunction with the Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria in a bid to create awareness on sickle cell.  ‘Strain’ is written by Donald Tombia, Oluwatoyin Adewumi & Eze Ekpo, and directed by Uduak-Obong Patrick. The film is produced by Oluwatoyin Adewumi and Benjamin Abejide Adeniran. Speaking on the film, Oluwatoyin Adewunmi says, “Strain was conceptualized after hearing the near-miss story of a family. During our research, we made a heart-wrenching discovery that about 150,000 children are still being born with sickle cell disease annually in Nigeria.” Continuing, she said: “At that point, we knew there was no going back on lending our voice to the prevention, management, and cure of the disease through storytelling. We want the movie to be a reference for discussions on Sickle Cell Disease and Genotype-match in general”.
