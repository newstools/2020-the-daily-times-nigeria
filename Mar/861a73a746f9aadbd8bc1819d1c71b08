Abuja – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has counseled the All Progressives Congress (APC) not to play politics with the Coronavirus (Covid-19) but join other wellmeaning Nigerians in seeking solution for the scourge. The party gave the advice in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Wednesday in Abuja. According to Ologbondiyan, it is on record that the APC was yet to offer any meaningful suggest on ways to address the raging pandemic. “Nigerians will recall that the PDP had on several occasions advised the Federal Government on effective pre-emptive measures as well as the need for concerted efforts and safeguards in the fight against Covid-19.

Ologbondiyan recalled that the PDP presidential candidate in 2019 general election,  Atiku Abubakar, on Tuesday advised the President to reduce the pump price of fuel and suspend stamp duties on all accounts as palliative measures against Covid-19, which was on Wednesday implemented. He said that the PDP would not be distracted in its commitment to the wellbeing and safety of Nigerians.
