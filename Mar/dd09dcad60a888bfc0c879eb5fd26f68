The Lagos State University Management has announced the postponement of the 24th Convocation Ceremonies of the University indefinitely. The Convocation Ceremonies were scheduled for Friday 20th to Friday 27th March, 2020. In a press statement signed by the Coordinator, Centre for Information, Press and Public Relations, LASU, Mr Ademola Adekoya, the postponement is as a result of the prevailing health threats occasioned by  Coronavirus pandemic and the resolution of the Federal and State Government to discourage the gathering of people in public places at this point.  The Management regrets every inconvenience this postponement might cause to all our graduating students, awardees, family, friends and other stakeholders of the University.  Further information on the 24th Convocation Ceremonies will be made available in due course. It would be recalled that former Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi was billed to chair the convocation lecture billed for Thursday March 26, 2020 and which the Emir has earlier given assurance of his presence on the said date.
