Bruno Fernandes will be playing his first Manchester derby as Manchester United face Manchester City in the Premier League. Fernandes has made a flying start with United following his January move from Sporting Lisbon for an initial £47 million ($61 million). The 25-year-old has scored three goals and provided two assists in his seven appearances, helping Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s team extend their unbeaten run to nine games in all competitions. Since the Alex Ferguson era ended in 2013, United have struggled to find players with the personality and presence to cope with the pressure of trying to emulate those golden days. But the influential Fernandes already appears a perfect fit.
