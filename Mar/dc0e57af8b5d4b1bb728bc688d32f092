The Nigerian Aviation
Handling Company Plc has taken back the ground handling operations of Ethiopian
Airlines Cargo and Mail Services, which was formerly handled by Skyway Aviation
Handling Company Limited (SAHCOL). The development is based on the provisions of the Standard
Ground Agreement Service (SGHA) signed on 1st October 2018 between NAHCO PLC
and Ethiopian Airlines. Head, Legal Services, NAHCO Plc, Mr Tayo Ogunbanjo, in a statement issued by the company and seen by Nairametrics disclosed on
Wednesday. According to him, the current SGHA between NAHCO and Ethiopian
Airlines is for three (3) years effective from 1st October 2018 covering
amongst others ground handling services, handling of cargo and mail generally. He said, “Ethiopian Airlines should ideally not have two
contracts running on the same cargo handling business. Since we have an
existing and bidding contract, we are simply exercising our right as stipulated
in that contract.” Also commenting, the Group Executive Director, Commercial and Business Development, NAHCO PLC, Prince Saheed Lasisi, said, “under Section 5 and as stated in Clauses 1.10 and 1.11 of our current contract, NAHCO is entitled to charge Export Terminal Charges to the Exporter and Import Terminal Charges to the Agent or Consignee.” Gunmen kill 3 in Benue According to him, consultations were made and clarifications

the company’s obligations and contracts. “As a law-abiding and corporately responsible entity, we choose
to deal on the right side of existing and extant laws and contracts.”
