Remember nature does not need you, we all need nature to survive. Truly, the world will NEVER remain the same again!!! To solve this ailment is through natural elements put together above all from nature. It has been tested!!! I have used it and also used it for some of the chronic Corona patients with testimonials. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS FOR GRANTED (The world did with the warning Last Year June). I also challenge researchers both in Nigeria and the world to make these natural herbs into clinical medicine and extract the vaccines from it. I am ready to work with them and provide huge access to the herbs. It is real and it works. I have a lot gathered together for the use of mankind.

I'm not even so bothered about the Ooni's so-called cure and the potency of those items.But do you guys understand that drugs go through multiple testing and trial stages before they're released to the public?You don't just come online to say Neem tree cures whatever. I like this Ooni of Ife. He's a perfect blend of western education and traditional African knowledge.
