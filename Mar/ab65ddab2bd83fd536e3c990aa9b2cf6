The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has granted a two-week market holiday to the Bureau De Change (BDC) operators. The
 President, Association of Bureau De Change Operators (ABCON), Aminu 
Gwadabe, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday, noting that this 
comes into effect from Friday, March 27. Mr. Gwadabe said this 
follows a request which was sent to the apex bank to grant the 
association market holidays given the ongoing challenges faced in local 
and global economies due to the impact of the Coronavirus (COVID -19) 
pandemic. He added that a notice of CBN’s approval was sent to BDC
 operators and directors, stating that sales of foreign exchange to BDCs
 is now suspended for a tentative period of two-weeks. He also 
advised the public not to go into panic buying, hoarding and patronising
 street traders as the apex bank has enough reserves to sustain supplies
 when the BDCs return to operations. “This is to urgently bring to
 the notice of our members nationwide that following our letter of 
recommendation to the CBN to grant us a market holiday on our bidding 
days as a proactive and preventive measure on the scourge of the novel 
COVID-19 and the ban on all air/land travels. “The CBN has granted
 our request, effective tomorrow Friday, March 27, 2020, there shall be 
no market days henceforth for a tentative period of two weeks,” the 
statement read in part. The ABCON President advised members to observe strict guidelines on the preventive measures on the dangers of the COVID-19. Gwadabe said that CBN/NFIU is tracking large movements of funds within the financial sector and the need to be cautious.
