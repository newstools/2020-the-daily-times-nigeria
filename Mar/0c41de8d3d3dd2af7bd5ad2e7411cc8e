Meghan Markle will narrate the forthcoming Disney documentary “Elephant,” her first role since her and Prince Harry announced they were stepping back from royal duties. Disney announced the film on Twitter, saying it will be available on its streaming service on April 3. The live-action documentary follows a family of elephants as they journey across southern Africa’s Kalahari Desert. Markle, an American, is no stranger to the entertainment industry, having played high-flying paralegal Rachel Zane in the US legal drama “Suits” before marrying Harry in 2018. She also appeared in television productions including “Fringe,” “Without a Trace,” “CSI: NY,” “CSI: Miami” and “The League.” Read also: Barcelona cuts wages for squad and staff due to coronavirus crisis She is also credited on feature films such as “Get Him to the Greek,” “Remember Me,” “A Lot Like Love” and “Horrible Bosses.” Meghan and Harry announced in January that they plan to “step back” from royal duties and lead a more independent, private life based mainly in Canada, starting this spring. The move, which was taken in part by their desire to become “financially independent,” prompted speculation about what jobs they would pursue. (dpa)
