The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on Monday commenced an indefinite strike action over government’s failure to pay their monthly wages through the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS). This is coming a few days after the academic union announced on March 9, that it was embarking on a two-week warning strike over the issue.

on Monday, the ASUU President, Biodun Ogunyemi said that the union has decided
to embark on total and indefinite strike from Monday 23. He explained that the action has become necessary following the federal
government’s refusal to address issues raised in its 2019 memorandum of understanding
as well as its objection to joining the Integrated Pay Roll and Personnel
Information System (IPPIS). The industrial action takes effect today, March 23. Recall that the
union commenced its warning strike on March 9. Since the commencement of the
strike, the government met with the union twice. ASUU is embarking on the strike over the non-payment of salaries of
their members who failed to enrol into the federal government’s IPPIS, the pay roll
software mandated for all public officials. The government last Thursday also reached an interim agreement with the striking
university lecturers to integrate the University Transparency and
Accountability Solution (UTAS) into the IPPIS. ASUU is opposed to the use of IPPIS for lecturers, saying it does not
consider some of the peculiar operations of universities. The lecturers’ union then developed its own UTAS which it wants the
government to adopt for universities.
