Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara state has revealed that his government has resolved with the military to resume full onslaught against unrepentant bandits in the state. This was contained
in a statement signed by the Special Adviser to the governor on Public
Enlightenment, Media and Communications, Zailni Bappa and made available to
newsmen on Wednesday in Gusau. Daily Times recalls that the state had in the
last two months recorded a gradual and steady resurgence of armed bandits and
kidnappers. According to him,
the fire power which has already taken effect in the state has started yielding
positive results. “It has led to the
rescue of 13 kidnap victims including the district head of Wuya in Anka Local
Government Area, who was kidnapped along with his son and the chief imam of the
village shortly after their afternoon prayer, last week,’’ he said. The statement said
the rescued victims have since undergone medical check-up at the state government’s
health facility and have been reunited with their family members. Bappa said the
victims were earlier handed over to Gov. Matawalle by the state Commissioner of
Police, Usman Nagogo. He added that while
the governor reiterated his administration’s ban on the volunteer security
group known as ‘San sa kai’, he however, warned that his administration would
deal decisively with any traditional leader found supporting the activities of
the outlawed group including being dethroned. The statement said
the renewed military action has also led to the arrest of seven informants to
the bandit, who would soon be moved to Abuja to face the consequences of their
actions.
