All Champions League and Europa League matches due to take place next week have been postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak, UEFA, the European football governing body, said on Friday. “In the light of developments due to the spread of COVID-19 in Europe and related decisions made by different governments, all UEFA club competitions matches scheduled for next week are postponed,” UEFA said in a statement. The governing body added that the Champions League and Europa League quarter-final draws scheduled for March 20 had also been postponed as a result. The decision comes ahead of a crisis meeting on Tuesday where UEFA would consider all options for the next period, including possibly postponing the Euro 2020 tournament scheduled for June and July. English Premier League side Chelsea, who were scheduled to travel to Bayern Munich for a last 16 Champions League game on Wednesday, have announced that winger Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive. They had added that their whole squad is also in quarantine. Tuesday’s Champions League matches between Juventus and Olympique Lyonnais and Manchester City and Real Madrid have already been postponed as players of Juventus and Real Madrid are in quarantine. That day, UEFA will hold a video conference of all 55 football federations along with club, league and player representatives to discuss the situation. The meeting will look at various options to finish the season and deal with the issue of Euro 2020, which could be postponed. Europe’s top football leagues have already been placed on hold because of the outbreak, which has killed over 4,900 people globally.
