The travel agents also noted that many Nigerians who were fond of going to China for business had diverted to Turkey to get their wares. He commended Aliko Dangote Foundation for donating N200 million to the Federal Government to help address the impact and prevention of the viral outbreak. He said there were plans to launch an awareness programme on coronavirus to be driven by WHO and Nigerian Centre for Disease Control during the forthcoming NANTA’s 44th AGM.He said this was to dispense information critical to managing the situation. “NANTA supports the very systematic approach of the health organisations and the aviation agencies at the airport in respect to coronavirus and other health related matters ravaging the world. “We also commend the airlines for standing strong at a period like this despite operational challenges to address and halt the spread. “NANTA is planning to set up a special call line to help those who want to reach out to us on the issue as it affects their travel to high-risk countries,” he said.
