Real Madrid will almost certainly be without injured goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and defender Marcelo for their UEFA Champions League last 16 second leg clash with Manchester City on March 17. The Spanish club confirmed on Tuesday that Courtois has a groin injury and Marcelo is suffering from a hamstring problem.
