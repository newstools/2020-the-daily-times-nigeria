Aliyu also said that the measure became imperative to ensure that the FCT residents do not suffer as a result of the strike by the resident doctors. She said  the FCT administration noted with dismay,  the continued strike embarked upon by the resident doctors, over irregularities in their salaries for the month of January and February 2020. ” Despite entreaties that the problem was not peculiar to the doctors, but affecting all staff of the FCTA; and efforts made by the office of the FCT Minister of State, with the Accountant General of the Federation, and an appeal to call off the strike, the doctors are yet to  resume work. ” In the meantime, the administration has given the striking doctors 24 hours to resume work, after which they should consider themselves as having exited the FCT administration,” she said. Aliyu, however, expressed the appreciation of the FCT administration for the commitment and dedication to duty of the Medical and Dental Association of Nigeria, nurses and midwives, medical laboratory technologists, pharmacists and other medical and health workers, who  remained true to their calling by putting social needs above self.
