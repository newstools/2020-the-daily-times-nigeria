With the current Coronavirus pandemic ravaging the world and an imminent lock-down of Nigeria as part of efforts to curtail the spread of the deadly virus, pop star Runtown has risen to offer succor to Nigerians who are in dire need of palliatives at this time. Runtown recently took to his Twitter to say, ‘hope everyone is staying safe. Times are extremely tough and I am certain there are people with no money t o stock up on survival essentials. I’ll be giving out 10 million Naira ti this cause. Kindly drop your account details’. ‘Obviously, 10 million naira would not go round, so if you have other means to sustain yourself, respectfully don’t send in your details’ he added. The dreaded Corona Virus is currently active in over 150 countries in the world with over 400,000 people infected and over 18,000 people dead while Nigeria currently has 51 cases recorded as at now. Runtown’s 10 million naira palliative comes after former presidential candidate; Atiku Abubakar announced a 50 Million Naira grant to the Federal Government of Nigeria to help fight the spread of the virus.
