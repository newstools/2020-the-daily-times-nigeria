Dolly Parton believes the coronavirus pandemic is a lesson from God, she revealed in an uplifting message to fans. The country icon shared a video filmed at her home on Friday, where she is hunkering down amid the global health crisis. She stands in front of a small flight of stairs before breaking out into song. “Well hello! It’s Dolly. Climbing the stairway to heaven ’cause this virus has scared the H-E-L-L out of us,” Parton sang while wearing a denim shirt and her blonde locks pulled up into a ponytail. “”I’m not making light out of the situation,” Parton continues, adding, “Well, maybe I am because it’s the light, I believe, that’s going to dissolve the situation. I think God is in this, I really do. “I think he’s trying to hold us up to the light so we can see ourselves and see each other through the eyes of love, and I hope we learn that lesson. I think that when this passes we’re all gonna be better people.” Parton said she has maintained a “positive attitude” despite the negativity and fears the pandemic has created around the world.
