Giving hints on the suspected case, Abayomi said: “He is a Nigerian who went to France, spent seven days in France, returned to Lagos three days ago and presented with headache and some respiratory symptoms. “This is because he has been in a country where there is an active person-to-person transmission, it could be common cold and there is a possibility that it could be coronavirus. “He has been put in isolation, the test is being run right now, I am expecting the result.”
