The Federal Government has insisted that chloroquine has not been approved as a cure for the coronavirus disease otherwise reffered to as Covid-19. The warning came from the Director-General of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu who was  reacting to recent media reports that suggested that chloroquine could protect people from the coronavirus disease or treat patients that are already infected with the disease. The NCDC boss said,”Nigerians should please remember that the use of chloroquine and its derivatives for the management of COVID-19 disease has not been validated and approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). “There have been promising results by researchers but until then, the drug is not approved for use for COVID-19 treatment. “Nigerians should know that self-medication can cause harm and lead to death. “Do not misuse drugs. We understand these are challenging times, and Nigerians may be worried, but the Federal Ministry of Health, through the NCDC is doing everything it can to continue to ensure the safety and health security of every Nigerian. “Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have not been licensed to treat COVID-19 related symptoms or prevent infection’’. He added that until the World Health Organisation (WHO), have clear definitive evidence that the chloroquine  was safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19, it should not be misused. In addition to responding to the outbreak, NCDC has begun a communications campaign to debunk misinformation and provide Nigerians with facts to protect their health. Recall that it was reported some days back that the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) approved the production of Chloroquine for clinical trials. However, the Director-General of the agency, Mojisola Adeyeye, pointed out that NAFDAC is not approving Chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 but only for clinical trials to find treatment for the virus
