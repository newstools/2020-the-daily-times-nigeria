 .Says his banishment, confinement to Nasarawa an infringement of his rights Deposed Emir of Kano, Alhaji Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, has dragged the Kano State government, Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Inspector General of Police and Department of State Security Service before a Federal High Court in Abuja over his alleged unlawful banishment to Awe town in Nasarawa State. Kano State government had on Monday, March 9, 2020, announced the dethronement of Sanusi as emir, on grounds of alleged disregard to constituted authorities, disloyalty, and refusal to attend council meetings amongst others. Shortly after his dethronement, he was banished to Loko town from where he was later moved to Awe town both in Nasarawa State where he is currently. But the vocal former traditional ruler said that his banishment and subsequent confinement to Nasarawa State is an infringement of his fundamental human rights as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution. Sanusi in the fundamental human rights suit instituted in Abuja on March 12, is therefore praying the court to void his banishment to Nasarawa State and order his release so that he can enjoy his fundamental rights as provided by law. In the suit with no: FHC/ABJ/ CS/357/2020, the former emir specifically wants the court to restore his right to human dignity, personal liberty, freedom of association and movement in Nigeria apart from Kano State. The suit is brought pursuant to section 34, 35, 40, 41 and 46 of the 1999 Constitution and Order 4 Rule 4 of the Federal High Court. Other respondents in the legal action are the Inspector General of Police and Director General, State Security Service (SSS). Sanusiâ€™s legal team of about 30 lawyers including 12 Senior Advocates of Nigeria, is headed by Prince Lateef Fagbemi, SAN.
