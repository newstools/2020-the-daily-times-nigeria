…Launches social club against drug abuse Worried by the rising rate of drug abuse among youths, which is more prevalent among secondary schools students, a non-governmental organisation, Trauma Savers Life Support Foundation (TSLS) has premiered its movie ‘The Scourge’ which gathered top notch attendance with the presence of the First Lady of Lagos State, Mrs. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, politicians, socialites and above all secondary school students who are the major target of the project. A production of Trauma Savers Life Support Foundation and directed by Saidi Balogun, ‘The Scourge’ parades stellar performances by Wole Ojo, Saidi Balogun, Mustapha Agbolade , Jide Kosoko, Tobi Bakre, Ricardo Agbor, Allwell Ademola to mention amongst others. The film intends to show the ill sides of drug abuse, how it could be tackled and a life after its abuse. The convener, Mrs. Yinka Olaiya said: “It’s easier to pass a message through entertainment as it’s an easy way to attract people and this medium is where our message would be passed easily. The movie has a tone of tragedy but with a happy ending. I remember when I was in secondary school, drugs were not common. “If you want to get high, maybe it will be on sugar. Drug addiction now is a global thing, and it is not only in Nigeria. The United Nations has said the drug rate in Nigeria would be higher in five years than anywhere in the whole world, which is why the foundation is paying attention to it now.” Reiterating the danger of drug addiction, the First Lady of Lagos State, Mrs. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu noted that the need to sensitise and make known the danger of illicit drug abuse is necessary at this point in time as the present administration totally frown at such. She however commended the convener and her team for a job well done charging them never to relent on preaching the gospel of change to youths. Be the Change group was also unveiled at the event as a support system for the eradication of drug abuse.
