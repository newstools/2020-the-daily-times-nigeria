Consumer retail spend over chatbots will reach $142billion by 2024, rising from $2.8billion in 2019. This represents average annual growth of 400 per cent over the next four years, the latest report from Juniper Research revealed. The
research, titled Chatbots: Vendor Opportunities & Market Forecasts
2020-2024, identified the retail sector as a key beneficiary of advances in NLU
(Natural Language Understanding) technologies. It
forecast that NLU would be essential in providing a seamless retail experience
for users and to establish chatbots as a reliable retail channel as it enables
chatbots to efficiently process human inputs and produce more accurate
automated responses to users. The new report forecasts that advances in NLU capabilities will drive the effectiveness
of chatbots. It anticipates that over 50 per cent of retail chatbot
interactions will be completed successfully by 2024, without the need for human
intervention. As a
result, retailers are urged to implement chatbots as part of a wider
omnichannel retail strategy in order to maximise their presence on a number of
key retail channels. Additionally,
it was found that 80 per cent of global consumer spend over chatbots will be
attributable to discrete chatbots by 2024. These
are embedded directly into a retailer’s mobile app, rather than accessed
 via a browser or messaging application. The research anticipates that 
control over
development and the ability to retain company branding will drive 
discrete
chatbots to become the most popular chatbot medium in retail. It’s
also forecast that 70 per cent of the global number of chatbots accessed by
2024 would be attributable to the Far East and China. Furthermore, over $80 billion
will be spent via chatbots in China in 2024, accounting for over 55 per cent of
global chatbot spends in that year.
