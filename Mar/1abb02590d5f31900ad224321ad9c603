Speaking about this , Luminee as she is popularly called disclosed that when a friend of her named  Adunni wore one her clothes and posted it on instagram; actress Mercy requested for the designer and ever since  she made a piece for her, they have both maintained a cordial relationship of over few years. Recounting one of her biggest moment; Luminee as she is fondly called noted that one of her biggest moment which also help give her brand more prominence was the dress she made for Aigbe, which she wore to the 2016 Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Awards (AMVCA), which won her the best dressed award at the event, and which wowed the over 5,000 guests at the Eko Hotel Convention Centre and a global TV audience. However it is important to note that since the very first time I made a dress for her, she made me her designer and kept supporting my brand till now and through her I can boldly say she made my breakthrough, made me popular, connected me to other celebrities  and clients. If anyone would tell me my brand will be this big now, I will question such a person but in all, I believe this is God’s calling for me, especially when I didn’t learn it; it was just in thing “I had to put in a lot of hard work so that people will accept me, and that is how I arrived where I am today.
