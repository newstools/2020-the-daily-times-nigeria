Basketball Africa League President Amadou Gallo Fall confirmed the postponement in a statement released by the NBA. “Following the recommendation of the Senegalese government regarding the escalating health concerns related to the coronavirus, the BAL’s inaugural season will be postponed,” Fall said. “I am disappointed we are not able to tip-off this historic league as scheduled but look forward to the highly-anticipated launch of the BAL at a later date.” Twelve club teams from across Africa had been due to participate in the league, which is backed by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) and the NBA. It is the first time the NBA has helped organize a league outside North America.
