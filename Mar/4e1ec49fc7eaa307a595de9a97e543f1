Organization (WTO) says that the impact of Coronavirus may have a ‘substantial’
impact on global economic growth. The World Economic outlook report by the International Monetary Fund has projected global growth to be at 3.3 per cent in 2020 IYC opposes interim management committee for amnesty scheme However, the
head of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Roberto Azevedo on Monday said that
he expects the coronavirus epidemic to have “substantial” impact on the global
economy, although there are plans for a June ministerial meeting. Azevedo
disclosed this while addressing heads of delegations in a closed-door meeting
in Geneva on Monday. “The effects on
the global economy is also likely to be substantial and will start to show up
in the trade data in the weeks to come,’’ Azevedo said. “For MC-12 we
are proceeding as planned. Should the situation so demand, we will take any
necessary action,” he added, referring to the June ministerial meeting in
Kazakhstan. The meeting,
expects member states to clinch deals on agriculture, e-commerce and fisheries
subsidies, among other topics, is expected to have several thousand
participants. A successful outcome is considered as critical to the legitimacy and relevance of the global
body after the collapse of the WTO’s dispute appeals system due to the U.S.
blocking of appointments. Other member
states also voiced concerns about the slow progress on the talks which aim to end
harmful subsidies to the fishing industry that are depleting global fish
stocks. Azevedo recently
expressed hope that a deal was possible. “It is incumbent
on all of us to recognise that the negotiations are in serious trouble,” U.S.
Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea told trade delegates on Monday. Shea added that
some members were “fiercely defending” rights to subsidise or do so in the
future, without naming the countries.
