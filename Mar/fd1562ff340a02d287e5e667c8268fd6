The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has said that the current power supply shortage experienced in the country is as a result of low gas supply which has restrained the ability of many thermal power stations to generate optimally. In a statement signed by the General Manager (Public Affairs), Ndidi Mbah, the TCN said the thermal power plants affected by gas supply constraint include Sapele NIPP, Olorunsogo NIPP, Ihovbor NIPP and Azura Edo power plants. Other thermal power plants equally affected, but generated at lower capacities include Egbin (steam), Sapele (steam), Delta (gas), Geregu (gas), Omotosho (gas), Olorusogo (gas), Geregu NIPP, Alaoji NIPP, Omotosho NIPP, Odukpani NIPP, Okpai (gas/steam) and Omoku (gas) power generating plants. She disclosed that these thermal power plants generated zero megawatts as at the weekend. “TCN wishes to inform the public that the nation’s power sector is experiencing power supply shortage caused by low gas supply which has restrained the ability of many thermal power stations to generate optimally,” the statement explained. She noted that as a result of the prevailing gas constraints, there has been significant reduction in the quantum of power transmitted to the various distribution companies for onward supply to electricity consumers across Nigeria. Furthermore, she disclosed that the TCN has however, discussed with the management of some of the affected power plants and many of them attributed their challenges to gas pipeline and processing maintenance being carried out by their gas suppliers. “According to the management of some of the affected power plants, the maintenance of gas facilities are expected to last for 10 days.  Therefore, it is expected that the gas supply challenges will ease before the end of next week,” the statement revealed.
