According to the audio in circulation online, President Buhari and his Chief of Staff, Mr. Abba Kyari, have been flown out of the country for treatment. In the audio, a lady narrated how the alleged trip was arranged, claiming that she got the information about it from her friend whose husband is the pilot contacted to fly President Buhari and Mr. Kyari abroad.
