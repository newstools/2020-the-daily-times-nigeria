The Department of
State Services (DSS) says it is not laying siege on Premium Times and has not hacked the phone of any of its staff. Public Relations
Officer of the service, Dr. Peter Afunanya disclosed this in a statement on
Monday in Abuja. Afunanya said reports in some sections of the media that the service was laying siege on Premium Times and had hacked the phones of one of its staff were not true. Okowa lauds army synergy with sister agencies in combating insecurity According to him,
it is unfounded and a needless sensationalism because there is no such
operation at the moment by the service. “If there is any
need for the DSS to discharge its duty, it sure has to do that with every sense
of decency and in accordance with laid down procedures. “The service is not
anywhere near the media organisation and therefore, the report should be
disregarded,” he said.
