Valencia (Spain) – Visiting Atalanta’s Josip Ilicic scored four goals in a stunning individual display to lead them to a 4-3 UEFA Champions League last 16 second leg win over Valencia on Tuesday. The Italian side thus completed an 8-4 aggregate victory, at an empty Mestalla stadium. The Spanish side’s stadium was shut to supporters as part of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus, with the visitors coming from a high-risk zone in the north of Italy. Valencia defender Mouctar Diakhaby conceded two penalty kicks in the first half, both converted by Ilicic, either side of Kevin Gameiro’s equaliser.
