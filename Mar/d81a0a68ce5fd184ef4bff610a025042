NBA referee Courtney 
Kirkland has been cleared by doctors to depart Sacramento after 
coronavirus test results returned negative, ESPN reported Sunday. Kirkland,  who has officiated more than 1,200 games in 20 seasons as a league  referee, has been cleared to resume all activity without restrictions,  according to the report on the sports network’s website, citing unnamed  sources. ‘Football can wait’: Italy coach Mancini ready to play Euros in 2021 The news comes four days after Kirkland had been scheduled
 to officiate the Sacramento Kings’ home game against the New Orleans 
Pelicans. But the contest was postponed minutes before tipoff 
because Kirkland had also worked the Utah-Toronto game on Monday in Salt
 Lake City. The move was made in the wake of Utah All-Star center 
Rudy Gobert of France testing positive for COVID-19 just before a 
scheduled game Wednesday. Another Utah player, Donovan Mitchell, also tested positive for coronavirus. Kirkland, 45, was tested on Thursday and isolated himself until receiving the results. NBA
 commissioner Adam Silver put the league season on indefinite hiatus 
after Gobert tested positive, a move that was followed by every major US
 sports organization over the next two days.
