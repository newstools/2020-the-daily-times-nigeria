go higher tomorrow, no it may go further downward,” he said. The DPR boss who
expressed satisfaction at the level of compliance in Warri and environs, urged
other petroleum products users to adjust their prices in the overall interest

dispensed at approved pump price and the right quantity to consumers.

marketers in Delta are complying and we hope that the downward review of the
price of PMS  will also translate into
downward review of the cost of transportation for the ordinary citizen.”
