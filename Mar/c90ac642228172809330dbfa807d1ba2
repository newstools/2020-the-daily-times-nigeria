Adeshina Fagbenro-Byron was the presidential candidate of
the Kowa Party in the 2019 election. In this interview, he reflects on the
election, the worsening security situation in the country, why restructuring is
the only panacea to Nigeria’s development crisis and why the Peoples Democratic
Party (PDP) must humble itself and form alliance with other political parties
if it intends to return to power in 2023 among other issues. PATRICK OKOHUE
reports. **********Many people were surprised that you became inactive at the latter stage of the 2019 presidential race, what really happened? Panic as 23 suspected coronavirus cases identified in 5 states I think up till November 2018 if you count seven or eight
candidates in the race my name would always be there. But when they started
doing polling for candidates who would take part in the debate, prior to that
time there were also talks about the presidential candidates, especially among
the young candidates, I was in all the discussions, especially the one that had
Sowore, Donald Duke, Ezekwesili, Mogbalu, we went for several of those meetings,
but we could not arrive at an agreement is issue for another day and you would
realise that even the Kowa Party we were in the CUPP and that was the platform
and strategy that we thought we had a good opportunity. For two things, if you read my development plan I warned
that these things happening now would happen. I was very clear in what needed
to be done and how we needed to do it. So when our party decided to join CUPP
it was predicated on three reasons. Firstly, the need to restructure the
country and secondly to upstage APC and thirdly to form a broad based
government. The argument was that PDP on its own could never win APC,
for the fact that people were disgruntled with APC does not mean that people
had forgiven PDP. PDP ought to have realised that they had a major image
problem. The only way you would go into an election like that no matter how
rich you are is to form an alliance with people who have a more credible image
than you. APC could never have won the 2015 election if it did not go
into alliance with other parties. Buhari himself had a credibility problem in
2015; people had the fear that he was extreme in his religion and ethnic
beliefs. But in order to redeem this he had to associate with others. PDP
should have done the same thing under CUPP, but they allowed pride and belief
in money and it pushed the party into reneging in its agreement with CUPP. The agreement was that all the presidential candidates under
CUPP should come together and choose a presidential candidate and a
vice-presidential candidate. It was agreed that this was not an entirely a PDP
affair, but a coalition affair. At the CUPP it was agreed that the president
and the vice should not come from PDP, but they just picked their vice and
forgot all of us at the CUPP after all that. And then we also had a meeting
where the presidential candidates were asked to come and endorse the
presidential candidate, Obasanjo, Oyinlola were there, I never stepped down, I
refused. There were other forces pulling in the APC and PDP. This is just to
say that I did not step down, the only platform I would have stepped down is
the CUPP platform. Going back to pre-November, I said that I was not invited to
the debates, which makes it look like I was no more in the race. But in August
last year after the 2019 election and they had assumed office, I got this
letter from the organisers of the poll and debates; that it was a computer
error that excluded me in those polling which caused why I was never invited to
any of them. I was in the race and had a pedigree; even Oby Ezekwesili came out
to say that the person he wanted to debate with was me. So I think I was
deliberately excluded. But I am happy that the organisers admitted that in the
letter. I was a candidate and I never endorsed Atiku, probably if the CUPP
platform had worked maybe I would have stepped down, while a candidate emerged. PDP was a bigger party; but if the vice-president was chosen
from another region, the party would have done better in the presidential
election, but the PDP was arrogant, short-sighted and it was clear that the
arrangement was met to fail. ************But the assumption then was that most of you
were bought over by the ruling party to scuttle Atiku’s ambition? That was the fault of INEC, by registering more than 35
political parties in a day. It was part of an attempt to delude the system; it
was called divide and rule. But the Kowa party had integrity and I was a strong
candidate, we had our own supporters. ***********But apart from not being invited to debates you
were also not visible with campaigns and not seen on the street? Yes, I must admit this, there were issues and there were
internal problems in the party. Funding was part of it. Atiku did not win but
he had funding, for me there was deliberate sabotage on my campaign from within
the party.  The debate thing was very
critical too. But within the party it was misunderstanding, people who did not
believe in themselves, some within the party were dragging us toward APC, some
toward PDP. People wanted to see your hand, and I told them I was not
backing out. There are episodes on television, even on national television
where we had these CUPP thing discussed and I said I would not back down. But
as we are pushing forces were pushing us back, I needed just one debate to
prove. ***********But is consensus candidate a bad option
considering the system we run? It is not bad at all; that is why I emphasis the role of
CUPP, and I say today the only way opposition can win in 2023 is to resuscitate
and solidify the CUPP. Without that, PDP cannot win in 2023, it had not yet
found its credibility. They must step down from their high horse. They must
admit their inadequacies, it is not about money, spread, and it is about
attitude and credibility. ************Since you contested do you agree with the result
of the presidential election and the PDP server claims? For me I would not get into all that server issue.
Personally I think the strategy of the opposition was wrong and they gave
opportunity for Buhari and APC to win. Yes, there was rigging in all side. APC
won, but having a vice-presidential candidate from the South East was
wrong.  The South East was not going to
vote for the APC in the first place. So it was wasted energy, the
vice-presidential candidate of Atiku should have come from the South West to go
directly at APC; Osibanjo played a key role in APC’s victory. The South West was the battle ground. It was a failure, but
they did not listen and learn. I know how they operate; I contested for a
chairmanship position in PDP in 2001, so I know how they operate. **********So you agree APC and Buhari won? APC won the election, someone has to win. We can see for the
fact that someone won. I did not say he won the election free and fair. When
you throw your valuables on the floor, when someone picks it up you don’t call
that person a thief. The votes from the Northern states like Kano, Borno and
the rest have always been suspicious, but the PDP had benefited from it before
so you have to come to equity with clean hands. I was not in a position to
challenge the votes in Borno, I was not there. But you know Nigerian politics,
on the day Buhari was campaigning in the North, 600,000 people walked into
Nigeria through the border from Niger unchecked by custom, immigration and the
police. They said they came to campaign for someone they called their brother.
If 600,000 people can come in during campaigns, imagine how many would come in
during election. So that is why we are saying when you have power restructuring
is inevitable. You are also a lawyer, do you agree with the Supreme Court’s
ruling on Atiku petition on the election? Atiku went to the tribunal on wrong premise; if I was his
lawyer I would do my argument on the basis of where I noticed that votes were
manipulated and inflated. Everybody saw that there was underage voting. You
can’t say on that basis the election was not credible. But PDP did it in other
areas. PDP should have challenged the results in some states. Someone sold
Atiku a dummy on the server thing; if you say I have a server and I said I don’t,
how do you want to hold me? The bad spot were questionable votes in some states
by the time you cancelled the votes it would have reduced Buhari’s votes in
total. **********The Kowa Party has just been deregistered by INEC,
how do you react? No, we won election in the past.  The current speaker of the Bayelsa House of
Assembly was elected on the plate of the Kowa party, but he defected. Do INEC
want to make Nigeria a one party state? 
They want to make it a winner takes all, that is the logic. I know 70,
80 parties could be cumbersome for INEC but not all parties should contest
election. Some parties may not be registered to contest election;
their intention may be towards public service. Others may not have agenda to
win election outside Lagos State. I may be in a party to advocate for
environmental issues and so on; we have the Green Party in the UK and several
of them in the UK. But INEC should be sophisticated enough to say if you have
not won election in certain places or certain number of elections; you would be
limited to state election or local government elections only. But ones a party
is registered, you have admitted that they are qualified; so a party that was
rigged out in an election you would say they are not qualified to contest
again? You never know the sense or nonsense in a decision until you stress it
to the extreme. Are you saying if a party won second place in a governorship,
or presidential elections they have not done enough? There is a problem with the process; nobody begged INEC to register
large number of parties in the first place. ***********The assumption is that most of the parties are
being used as front and are not on ground? It is up to INEC to do investigation before registering
them. When did ANC win election in South Africa? But they were formed around
1920’s, but they did not win any elections until in 1994. So INEC is behaving
much like a service agency of the ruling class and the ruling class mentality;
that if you don’t have money, if you can’t have this go away. Their clam that the majority won is not true because
democracy is not for the majority. It is for the people who include the
minority, it is to protect the minority. You can’t say that if a company doesn’t
make money or something it should be deregistered. A company is formed for
economic reasons; political party is for political reasons, it is wrong. ***************What is your view on agitation for power
shift to the South in 2023? What I would say is that rotation of the presidency is
internal agreement of the PDP; so you know many people in PDP joined APC. But personally to me, this arrangement of sharing positions
is not based on merit, but a gentle man’s agreement. I don’t know when it was
decided that we should rotate power. **************But is it now fair, considering the divisive
nature of Nigeria? No, the fairest thing is to allow someone who can deliver
emerge, contest and win election on merit. Even if you have a president from
the North, the zone would still suffer poverty. If you have someone from the
South, they would still suffer same poverty. Rotation is not the solution; it would only guarantee
fairness to political distribution of the money. It would not guarantee
fairness and good governance to the North or South. When you bring someone who
lacks the capacity to deliver the people would suffer. If people can hire staff based on competence, why not do
same for Nigeria? But they would not, because of the love for sharing of the
country’s resources. I can say that it is not a question of North and South, if
you restructure Nigeria into workable and manageable system it does not matter
who becomes the president it would work. When you have a structure that is
based on rent system and distribution then you are not calling for capacity you
are saying it does not matter. El-Rufail says power should go to the South; I
would ask him to seek for the restructuring report first and read what it says. Most leaders in the South West don’t care about the
presidency now; we have had it before it did not yield anything. Most leaders
in the zone are clamouring for restructuring of the country. There are many
Nigerians questioning the basis of having one country and those people have
legitimate reasons. ***********But the Igbos think it is their turn? People would continue to be marginalised because there is a
history. During the country’s first coup, second coup and the civil war,
opinions were formed about the different ethnic groups. So I agree the Igbos
are victims of marginalization, but everybody are being marginalised in some
ways. Who is more marginalised than a woman and child in Borno State and a
woman in Zamfara State who is trying to walk to the farm? The security situation is bad and it was predicted. The
government is using kid-gloves for Boko Haram; the right thing is to review the
security apparatus and personnel. The President does not want to widen his
scope. I believe there is plenty of collusion. So what is happening is failure
of intelligence or deliberate refusal to use intelligence or intelligence going
to wrong hands. ************Do you regret contesting the 2019 presidential
election? No, contesting in the 2019 presidential election is the best
thing I ever did, because firstly; I was able to throw out the issues. I did
what God wanted me to do. There was fire on the mountain and I shouted. Though,
the financial implication may be much, but if I want to be president I must be
ready to make sacrifices. Secondly it was a beautiful education that I would
never learn in any school. If another opportunity comes I would contest in
2023.
