Wives of police officers fighting  Boko Haram  in the North-East  have told  the Federal Government to immediately redeploy  their husbands from the battling round. The women, who marched through some streets in  Jos dressed in black attire,  protested against the killing of  their husbands by the  insurgents without anything being done by the government. One of the protesters, who gave her name as Mrs Gabriel,  said, “Our hearts are troubled. Every day, we are being turned  into widows due to the  fight against Boko Haram in the North-East, because our husbands who are deployed in the region are daily being killed by the terrorists without anything being done. “The situation is unbearable to us.” Another protester,  Mrs Ilya,   said, “Why are our husbands not  being redeployed according to the terms of their engagement? Some of them have overstayed in their places of assignment, yet they just abandon them to their fate,   making them easy preys to the terrorists who have  sophisticated weapons. “Many of them have been killed with the information kept secret from their families,  while those who managed to be alive are not allowed to visit their families for many years. “The Federal Government should have pity on us and save our husbands from avoidable death. “That is why we are calling on the  government  to redeploy  them before we all become widows.” Spokesman for the State Police Command, Ubah Ogaba, when contacted said the command was aware of the protest. Ogaba added that the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Isaac Akinmoyede, was making plans to summon the women for a stakeholders’ meeting with a view to finding out what  the problems were and how they could be amicably resolved.
