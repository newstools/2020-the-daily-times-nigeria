The appointment of  Senator Elisha Abbo the senator representing the Adamawa North Senatorial District in Adamawa State at the Nigerian 9th National Assembly as the patron of the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) has received criticism from many Nigerians The
questions begging for answers will be why will an industry of great magnitude
and reputation pick an Elisha Abbo as patron? What will a patron as
Elisha Abbo bring to the table of a great movie industry that is growing by the
day with a global appeal to Nigerians? The president of the AGN, Mr Emeka Rollas must tell the world the motive behind this move and is he the only Nigerian that is best suitable at this time for this position  AGN’s  patron? 2020 UTME: JAMB denies cancelling any result We at
DaliyTimes joins other actors and actresses in Nigerians to call for the
delisting of Elisha Abbo  the man that was caught on camera slapping a
woman at an adult toy shop in Abuja as patron of AGN. AGN should not be in romance with this kind of man and Emeka Rollas and others should look for a better patron who can give the needed push that the Industry (Nollywood) need at this time and moment Emeka Rollas and his team should know that women are powerful in the entertainment world hence an Abbo as patron is an affront on the rights of women and gender equality And according to Hilda Dokubo   Abbo’s appointment as patron is disgusting” and a mockery of every positive value that the guild stands for. Kate Henshaw  said: ‘Abbo Elisha is NOT worthy to be a patron of the Actors Guild of Nigeria. We have women in this guild and we do not want to be slapped!!!” DailyTimes a major stakeholder in the creative and performing arts hence call the AGN to order on this and demand a quick change of patron with immediate effect and the resignation of the so called president Emeka Rolls for this affront we have to start holding ourselves accountable Has AGN forgotten so soon that when Abbo was  caught on camera beating a woman after she pleaded with him not to physically assault the shop-owner  many Nigerian celebrities  called for the immediate arrest of Abbo, for the physical assault on the lady. Recalled that Don Jazzy, among other celebrities, took to social media expressing their displeasure at the viral video, calling for Sen. Abbo’s arrest. Here are some of  Nigerian celebrities reactions then @BankyW tweeted, “I’ve been saying we need to pay attention to who we let into the National Assembly. Now look: a sitting senator caught on camera assaulting a woman. “These are our “leaders”. our “lawmakers”. Shame on us. Elisha Abbo should face the full wrath of the law. @PeterPsquare “I’m so mad right now after watching the video clip of our representative assaulting a woman. “People like Elisha Abbo do not deserve to handle public office. This is disgusting. He needs to be arrested. @DonJazzy “Sir Osinbajo, things like this should not go unpunished in our dear country. “We all have to be accountable for our actions. This person I’m seeing here like this cannot be a senator. #SenatorStepDown. Cc @profosinbajo,” he wrote. @MI_Abaga “Elisha Abbo is a fucking woman beater and shame on the police officer who stood by. @KateHenshaw “Shame on you Elisha Abbo, senator representing Adamawa north senatorial district. Shame on you. Putting hands on anyone is not acceptable. Shame on you. Radio personality, Toke Makinwa, shocked at the senator’s actions, expressed her contempt over his action. According to Makinwa, in spite of the clamor by Nigerians for young people to get into political offices, people with questionable character should not be allowed into leadership. “It is surprising that a young senator will get himself involved in such a humiliating and embarrassing act. “I am so tired of being tired 😓. We ask for a chance, we preach #not2young2run. “We shout and shout and just when we get excited that we have some young people who can represent us and effect real change, #ElishaAbbo goes and does this. “A serving senator, I hope the people of his constituency come out in numbers, I hope @muhammadubuhari @profosinbajo the president of the Senate. “The speaker of the house, @rt.hon.femigbajabiamila the Nigerian police cc @opetodolapo @nigerianpoliceforce and everyone comes together to get him out of the office immediately. “Oga @dinomelaye, pls check your colleague, he must pay for this. #senatorstepdown,” she wrote.
