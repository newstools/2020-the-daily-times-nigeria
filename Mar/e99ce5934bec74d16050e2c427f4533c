American 9/11 bombings, the Al-qaida attacks in Algeria and Syria, and the
rising insurgencies in the north-east of Nigeria. ”Before now, terrorism used to be a strange crime in Nigeria. We should
not politicise insecurity. ”We should rather buckle up, synergize and attack this menace and create
an enabling environment that will allow our people go about their businesses
without molestation. ”We condemn the unnecessary attacks, the maiming and killing of our
people; it is strange in our society, but now that it is here, we have to
collaborate with government because it is a combination of the efforts of
government and that of the citizens that will end insecurity. ”Government is doing what they can do, but a lot still needs to be done.
We want government to continue to do more to address the problem. ”Peaceful co-existence is very important and national integration is the
framework upon which we have to drive our society because Nigeria belongs to
all, irrespective of religions, ethnic or political affiliations,” he said. The governor reminded Nigerians that security men have been trained to
tackle insecurity and urged everyone to support them, and pray to God to help
the country to overcome the situation. “Government must work to root out terrorism in the country, but it cannot
do that alone,” he added.
