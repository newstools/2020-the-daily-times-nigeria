The Nigeria Football Federation{NFF} on Monday called on Nigerian
football family including stakeholders to pray hard in view of recent deaths
and kidnappings of football players which have caused serious concern in the
polity. President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Mr. Amaju Melvin Pinnick said the deaths of three footballers in a horrendous auto crash along Benin-Agbor Road on Sunday, among them Rangers International FC star forward Ifeanyi George, and the kidnappings of Enyimba FC’s Dayo Ojo and Abia Comets’ Benjamin Iluyomade in Ondo State some hours later were huge causes for concern in Nigeria’s football firmament.

bear. We must seek spiritual solace and seek help from Almighty God. I am short
of words following these deaths and kidnappings. We must all get involved in
prayers to Him to stop the tap of grief and sorrow in our football sector. “I am heartbroken. Not long ago, we lost Tiamiyu Kazeem of Remo
Stars Football Club and Chineme Martins of Nasarawa United in different
circumstances. We need to call on God to show us mercy and stop these
unfortunate happenings.” George, a former Home-based Eagles star who featured for
Nigeria at the 5th African Nations Championship in Morocco early in 2018, died
in a car crash alongside Emmanuel Ogbu, a player of Rangers International
Feeder team and Eteka Gabriel, also a football player. All were in a car that
ran under a stationary trailer on the Benin-Agbor Road. Some hours later, in Ondo State, Enyimba FC of Aba’s Dayo
Ojo and Abia Comets’ player Benjamin Iluyomade were reported kidnapped in the
Owo area of Ondo State. “We also earnestly appeal to the kidnappers of Dayo and
Benjamin to release them unhurt to their families. We are going through too much at the same time, with the
coronavirus pandemic also around. We need serious prayers from everyone in the
football family,” Pinnick added.
