The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has ordered all airlines operating international and regional flights into Nigeria to issue health declaration forms to their passengers before arriving Nigerian airports or stand the risk of facing severe sanctions. NCAA General Manager, Public Relations, Samuel Adurogboye, gave the order in a statement on Thursday in Lagos. He said the airlines should also ensure that their crew members filled the forms. The warning the NCAA spokesman said is coming on the heels of the failure by some airlines operating international and regional flights into Nigeria to provide health declaration forms to relevant authorities when requested. The general manager said a letter to this effect has been issued to all airlines and other stakeholders. “In view of the above, airlines are to remind passengers to provide factual address and phone numbers to enhance contact tracing in case there is need to do so. “The health declaration forms will be collected and evaluated by the personnel of Port Health Services on the arrival of the passengers and crew members alike.
