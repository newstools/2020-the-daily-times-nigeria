Over Three hundred million primary school children who depend on school meals will no longer get them, due to closures triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The WFP said nearly half the 18 million children the organisation feeds itself through school meal programmes across 61 countries, were no longer receiving them. The agency said it was looking into alternative ways of providing children out of school with food, including take-home meals, “Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, some 300 million primary school children are now missing out on school meals on which they depend,” WFP spokesperson Elisabeth Byrs told reporters in an online briefing.
