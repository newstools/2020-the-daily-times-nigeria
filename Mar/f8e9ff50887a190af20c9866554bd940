New World Health Organization (WHO) guidance will help countries accelerate efforts to stop people with tuberculosis (TB) infection becoming sick with TB by giving them preventive treatment, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General  has said. Dr. Ghebreyesus  in her message to  mark the 2020 World TB Day said that a quarter of the world‘s population is estimated to be infected with TB bacteria. According to him, these people are neither sick nor contagious but they are at greater risk of developing TB disease, especially those with weakened immunity. She said that offering them TB preventive treatment will not only protect them from becoming sick but also cut down on the risk of transmission in the community. She said, ‘’As we mark World TB Day 2020, the disease remains the world’s top infectious killer. In 2018, 10 million people fell ill with TB worldwide and 1.5 million people lost their lives to this disease. ‘’COVID-19 is highlighting just how vulnerable people with lung diseases and weakened immune systems can be. ‘’The world committed to end TB by 2030; improving prevention is key to making this happen. Millions of people need to be able to take TB preventive treatment to stop the onset of disease, avert suffering and save lives”, said Dr Ghebreyesus said. She highlighted the importance to continue efforts to tackle longstanding health problems, including TB during global outbreaks such as COVID-19. ‘’At the same time, programmes already in place to combat TB and other major infectious diseases can be leveraged to make the response to COVID-19 more effective and rapid. ‘’Although some progress has been made towards targets set at the UN high-level Meeting on TB in 2018, TB preventive treatment has been largely neglected. Global leaders committed to ensuring access to TB preventive treatment to at least 24 million contacts of people with active TB and 6 million people living with HIV by 2022.
