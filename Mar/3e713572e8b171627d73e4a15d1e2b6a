The Presidency has condemned reports linking President Muhammadu Buhari to the dethronement of HRH Muhammadu Sanusi II from the position of Emir of Kano. In a statement, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu referred to such reports as unfair and untrue. He said that the President has no involvement whatsoever in the dethronement of HRH Muhammadu Sanusi II, adding that all such insinuations are untrue, malicious and politically motivated. According to him, the President does not have a history of intervening in the affairs of any state in the country unless the issue at hand is of national consequence.

He (Buhari) commended, and the people of Kano for keeping calm in the past few days of the dethronement announcement and prayed that the will of Allah will be done at all times and that the Emirate/State and its people continue to experience progress irrespective of who is on the throne.
