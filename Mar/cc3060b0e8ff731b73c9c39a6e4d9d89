The
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged President Muhammadu Buhari to end
his embarrassing lethargic approach to governance and the welfare of Nigerians,
and immediately proceed to Lagos to reassure Nigerians over the horrendous
Abule-Ado explosion that killed many, injured and rendered many more homeless. The party said with such a national calamity and attendant loss of lives and property, it is indeed strange that a leader could remain distant and not deem it fit to personally identify with the victims through a visit, but prefer to wait in the comfort of Aso Presidential Villa to be presented with photographs of the ugly incident. EU set to impose 30-day entry restrictions to counter Coronavirus The PDP
described as unfortunate that the Buhari Presidency always waits to be
reminded or prodded before identifying with the citizens and taking up
responsibility whenever the nation is confronted with critical issues that
directly affect the well-being and security of Nigerians. “Nigerians
had expected Mr. President to always lead from the front on serious national
issues as he promised, but this has not been the case, resulting in leadership
failure and myriads of security, economic, environmental and political problems
that had bedevilled our nation in the last five years,” said the party in
a statement by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan. The PDP
therefore, urged President Buhari’s handlers to immediately schedule a visit to
Abule- Ado, Lagos, so that the President can have an on-the-spot assessment of
the horrific incident and take corresponding action to avert a future
recurrence. The party
also called for a forensic investigation into the cause of the explosion, given
the conflicting reports on the cause of the incident.
