United Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Tuesday warned that the world was far off the path it needs to be on to reach climate goals agreed by the international community in 2015.  “We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5-degree or 2-degree targets that the Paris Agreement calls for,” the secretary general said, referring to the commitment made by countries to keep global average temperatures well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. His warning came in the foreword to a UN climate report, which confirms that 2019 was the second-warmest year on record, topped only by 2016.

A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years,” the UN weather agency chief said. “We have no time to lose if we are to avert climate catastrophe,” Guterres said at the launch of the “State of the Climate” report. The UN chief said the novel coronavirus and climate change were both “very serious problems” that must “be defeated.” But, he said, “it is important that all the attention that needs to be given to fight this disease does not distract us from the need to defeat climate change.” Guterres said the reduction in emissions due to the virus should not be overestimated, adding: “We will not fight climate change with a virus.” (dpa)
