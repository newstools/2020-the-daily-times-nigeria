Abuja – The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has launched a communication campaign “TakeResponsibility“ to prevent Coronavirus spread in the country. Just in: Groom says ‘No’ to marital vows, walks out on bride Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, Director General of NCDC, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Abuja, while giving an update on COVID-19 in the country. Ihekweazu said that as the COVID-19 situation in Nigeria evolved, NCDC and government agencies were taking the necessary measures to protect the health of Nigerians. “Preventing COVID-19 spread requires a whole-of-society approach and our call is for all Nigerians to “TakeResponsibility” for our health. “It will take collective efforts to share credible information widely across various channels,” he said. The NCDC boss called on Nigerians to build on the campaign by sharing critical prevention messages on COVID-19 within social and professional circles. He, however, urged them to use these key points in their messaging: # Wash your hands frequently with soap under running water or use an alcohol-based sanitiser. # Cough/sneeze into tissue and dispose properly or cough/sneeze into your elbow. # Get information only from official sources. # If you return from international travel, self-isolate for 14 days or call NCDC’s toll free number: 080097000010. Ihekweazu urged Nigerians to contact the centre for more updates on Covid-19 via www.covid19.ncdc.gov.ng. Nigeria has recorded 27 COVID-19 cases, 25 were being treated in Lagos, FCT, and Oyo states. Two cases had been discharged and there has been no death from COVID-19 in Nigeria.
