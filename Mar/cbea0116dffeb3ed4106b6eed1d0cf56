By pushing the season ticket renewal deadline back and confirming our policy if games were to be cancelled or played behind closed doors, we want to ease any concerns our loyal fans may have in the current circumstances. “They give Manchester United their support year after year, and at this time, we are committed to supporting them. Our message to them is clear-we are all in this together. We will continue to keep fans updated with any developments and, in the meantime, we encourage them to keep following the latest health advice and Government guidelines. As Ole and Casey said in their statement this week, stay safe, stay home and we hope to see you soon.” United will offer season ticket holders either a pro-rata rebate against their season tickets for next year or a pro-rata cash refund based on the number of games still to be played.
