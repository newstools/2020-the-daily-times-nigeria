As Nigeria battles to check the spread of the dreaded coronavirus
disease, Sen. Umaru Al-Makura (APC/Nasarawa South) has distributed 120 power
generating sets to traditional rulers in his constituency to boost
enlightenment in the rural areas. Sen. Al-Makura, while distributing the items in Lafia on Sunday, said that the gesture is to assist the traditional institutions on the critical roles they were expected to play toward mobilising their communities.

sets will power public address systems to be used for mass enlightenment and
sensitisation in rural communities that have no electricity,” he said. According to Sen. Al-Makura, local government offices of the All Progressives
Congress (APC) would also benefit from the gesture, adding that apart from the
power generating sets being distributed, plans were underway for an economic
empowerment scheme for his constituents where 2, 000 beneficiaries would get
N10, 000 each. Also, he revealed that he recently bought special books and other
materials worth over N4 million for pupils at the Comprehensive Special School
for the Physically Challenged in Lafia. Governor Abdullahi Sule lauded the people-oriented disposition of Sen. Al-Makura
routed through his various intervention programmes for his constituents. He said that his administration is leveraging on Al-Makura’s legacies
and would continue to do so for the benefit of the people and development of
the state. Meanwhile, Executive Secretary of the Border Communities Development
Agency, Capt. Junaid Abdullahi, has commended Al-Makura for his people-oriented
policies. Represented by the Deputy Director, Public Affairs, Sadiq Isah, the
executive secretary said that the agency has concluded arrangements to
construct two blocks of classrooms at Kwandere and Kanje Primary Schools to
support Sen. Al-Makura’s constituency interventions.
