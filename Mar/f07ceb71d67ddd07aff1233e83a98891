Lucia Bose, a former Miss Italy winner and one of the first divas of post-war Italian cinema, died aged 89, her family has announced on Monday. “Dear friends, I inform you that my mother Lucia Bose has just passed away. “She is already in the best of places,’’ her son Miguel, a well-known pop star in Spain and Italy, wrote on Twitter. Bose worked with several great Italian directors, starring for example in Michelangelo Antonioni’s Story of a Love Affair, from 1950, and Federico Fellini’s Satyricon, from 1969.
