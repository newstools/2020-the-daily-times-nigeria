Peter Whittingham, former Cardiff City, and Aston Villa ace has passed on at the age of 35. The demise of Whittingham was confirmed by his former club Cardiff via their official website. “It is with an immeasurable amount of sorrow that we must inform supporters that Peter Whittingham has passed away at the age of 35. We are heartbroken,” a statement from Cardiff’s official website read. “The news of Peter’s sudden and untimely passing has shaken us to our very foundation. Our love goes out to his wife Amanda, their young son and family. They are at the forefront of our thoughts and, on their behalf, we ask for their privacy to be respected at this unfathomably cruel and difficult time.” “First and foremost, Peter was a family man – and somebody who could light up a room with his sense of humour, warmth, and personality. Then, as a professional footballer – as a Bluebird – he excelled with talent, ease, grace, and humility. Nobody did it better. “The loss of Peter will be painfully felt by our city, supporters and indeed all who ever had the pleasure of knowing him. We love you Pete and your memory will eternally stay with us.” Whittingham scored four goals and provided 10 assists in 88 Premier League appearances during his career, and played at Under-21 level for England.
