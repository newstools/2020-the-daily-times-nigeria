 South Korea reported its lowest daily increase of new coronavirus cases in more than two weeks on Friday, with 110 new infections recorded and one more death.  The number of people cured in a day exceeded the number of daily new infections for the first time, according to news agency Yonhap. The majority of the cases – including 65 of the latest ones – were concentrated in the south-eastern city of Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongsang Province. Most of the infections are linked to followers of a Christian sect in Daegu, while an overnight increase of 17 cases in the city of Sejong has been linked to an outbreak in a government department, according to Yonhap. Globally there have been more than 125,000 confirmed cases of the virus as of Thursday morning, according to the World Health Organization. (dpa)
