Osogbo – Gov. Gboyega Oyetola of Osun has described the South-West Security Network, codenamed ‘Operation Amotekun’, as a child of necessity. He said that with the emergence of Amotekun, the South-West zone had become a safe haven. The governor said this during while receiving the leadership of Yoruba Unity Forum who were on a courtesy visit to his office on Wednesday in Osogbo. According to Oyetola, the critical security need of the entire zone at a point is creating avoidable fear for intending visitors to the region, thus necessitating the creation of the security outfit. “I will like to commend the entire Yoruba nation for standing up in support of the establishment of Amotekun. “The support has created an incentive and encouragement for it to stay. “I can assure you that Amotekun has come to stay and the entire zone is secure,” Oyetola said. Speaking earlier, the Chairman of the forum, Archbishop Ayo Ladigbolu, applauded Oyetola for prioritising security of lives and property of the citizens. Ladigbolu said that with the establishment of Amotekun for the security of the entire zone, Oyetola and his colleagues in the South-West had assured the Yoruba nation that the good old days were here again.
