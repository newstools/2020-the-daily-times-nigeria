with utmost seriousness and is why his administration has come up with measures
to tackle its outbreak. Part of the measures, he said was the formation of a strong task force
committee headed by the Deputy Governor, Nasiru Gawuna alongside other medical
practitioners. However, the state government has also suspended other gatherings,
including government functions until the situation is subsides. “I also met with religious leaders, both Muslims and Christians to
take some measures to protect mosques and churches. “Even at homes, I call on parents to practice the safety measures
at their homes as outlined by medical practitioners against the dreaded
disease. “We also wrote to our emirs to take proactive measures against the
outbreak of the disease in their emirates. By these proactive measures, I am
hopeful we shall mitigate the outbreak of the disease in our state because
despite its outbreak in Nigeria, Kano is yet to record a single case,” he
said The governor also stated that as part of measures to contain the
outbreak of coronavirus, his government has constituted enlightenment committees
across the 44 local government areas of the state as well sub-committees in the
484 wards in the state. He charged the general populace to redouble efforts in praying against
the virus and the peaceful coexistence of the state, and the nation at large.
