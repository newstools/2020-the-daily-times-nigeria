The Waziri Gobir Foundation has set up a N30 million health fund to 
support the fight against COVID-19 and other health challenges in Kwara. A statement signed on Friday by the Founder of the foundation, Waziri
 Gobir said that the gesture was to assist the state government in the 
fight against the virus in the state. He said that the donation was as a result of his tour of some leading
 health institutions in the state, and the need to upgrade facilities at
 the hospitals visited to meet the challenge posed by the deadly virus. Gobir explained that the fund was set aside for Kwara residents, 
especially those who might be unable to afford medical bills in the 
hospitals. “Five major hospitals in Kwara have been selected for the implementation of the first phase of the scheme. “They are General Hospital Ilorin, Sobi Specialist Hospital, Unilorin
 Teaching Hospital, Kwara Civil Service Hospital and Centre Igboro 
Children Specialist Hospital, Ilorin. “I commend the efforts of the various health workers in the State 
especially for the risk and time they sacrificed to protect us. “I also commend the efforts of the National Center for Diseases 
Control (NCDC) for taking decisive action to curtail the spread of 
Coronavirus in Nigeria,” the statement quoted Gobir as saying. The philanthropist, who handed N1m to each of the hospitals as 
mobilisation fund, urged all well-meaning Nigerians to support the 
efforts of the government towards eradicating coronavirus in the 
country. Gobir, had in the past, through his foundation, assisted the people 
of the state with interest-free loans, and other high impact social 
investment programs such as enterprise development, education support, 
job creation and youth empowerment programmes.
