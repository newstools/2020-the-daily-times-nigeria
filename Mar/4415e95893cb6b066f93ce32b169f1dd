The Osun state House of Assembly has passed into law the bill prohibiting kidnapping, banditry and ritual killings in the state. The bill was read for the third time by the committee of the whole having passed through two other stages to correct identified grey areas of bill. Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye stated that with the passage of the bill, Section 364 of the Criminal Code of Osun state which stipulates 10 years jail term for kidnappers stands repealed and replaced with the death penalty. Owoeye noted that where the life of the person kidnapped, restrained or seized is lost in the process, the kidnapper (s) is liable on conviction to be sentenced to death. The passed bill also states that “any person who kidnaps another person by any means or instils fear, tricks or compels another person to do anything against his will commits an offense. “Where the life of the person kidnapped is lost in the process and the kidnapper is liable on conviction, he or she is to be sentenced to death. “Not lost in the process, but he is released upon payment of a ransom or performance of a ransom act, the kidnapper is liable on conviction to repay the sum he/she received as ransom and to imprisonment for life and the ransom act shall be reversed. “Any person who knowingly or willingly allow his premises, building or place belonging to or occupied by him or her and which he has control over to be used for purposes or keeping a kidnapped person, commits an offense and liable on conviction to imprisonment for 15 years and such building shall be forfeited to government for public use.” The speaker while commending members of the assembly for their diligence stated that the bill will soon be transmitted to the state governor for his assent as soon as the administrative processes are completed.
