Cannes Lions has provided an update on contingency planning for the Festival, in light of the evolving global situation regarding Covid-19. The Festival is still scheduled to take place, as planned, from 22-26 June in Cannes, France. We continue to monitor the situation closely and follow all guidance from health and government officials. We remain fully committed to ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of our customers, employees, sponsors and partners. Innoson Motors partners UNIZIK Engineering Dept The Festival, working
closely with the Mayoral office of Cannes and the French Authorities, has
secured alternative dates of 26-30 October 2020, if changing circumstances
require us to postpone the event from June. If we do make that decision, we
will announce to our customers no later than 15 April 2020, sharing weekly
updates ahead of any announcement date. Irrespective of the
timing of the Festival, we want to reassure the global creative community that
we are fully committed to awarding Lions in 2020: all entries will still be
judged and awarded by our global juries. As things stand, anyone who is
submitting a Lions entry for 2020 should follow the existing process and
timeline. If anything about that process changes, we will issue a further
announcement. Simon Cook, Managing
Director, Cannes Lions, commented: â€œAs we stand today, all of our plans are
proceeding as scheduled and we are still working towards Cannes Lions 2020
taking place as planned on 22 June.
