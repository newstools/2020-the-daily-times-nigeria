Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun state has solicited support of the United States of America in the area of vocational education and mining. Gov. Oyetola made the remarks during a courtesy visit by the US Consul General, Claire Pierangelo and her team to his office on Monday in Osogbo. The governor said the state needs the US support in the area of technical and vocational education to enable the youths to be self -employed. He said that the state places more emphasis on vocational and technical education as conventional education did not give room for skills acquisition. “The conventional education does not give room for skills acquisition and the job is no longer there. But, if youths can learn skills, then they will be self employed and that is why we need your support,” the governor said. Gov. Oyetola also said that the state needs the support of the US in the area of mining, adding that the state is blessed with abundant mineral resources which have remained untapped.
