The decision comes after Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said he would prefer to postpone fixtures than play without fans behind closed doors, like many European leagues are now doing amid the health emergency. “Does football work without spectators?” he asked on Tuesday. “If the people can’t come there is no sense. We will follow what we have to do but I wouldn’t like to do it without the people. “In Spain it’s started with the games behind closed doors. It has happened already in Italy. I think it will happen here (in England).” Britain’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said on Monday that it saw “no rationale” in cancelling or postponing sporting events at this stage. UEFA and the English Premier League have decided to ban pre-match handshakes as a prevention method and many European matches are now being played behind closed doors this week because of the outbreak.
