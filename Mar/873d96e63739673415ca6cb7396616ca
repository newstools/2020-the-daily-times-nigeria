He told Kameme TV; “After I took her for introduction to my parents, I was told my father had another wife and we were thus brother and sister.” Njoroge added that he has come a long way with the lady he started dating after she ordered a shoe from him. On her own part, Wanjiku expressed fear of falling in love again. She said; “I cannot even fall in love with another person because I am scared he will also turn out to be my relative.”
