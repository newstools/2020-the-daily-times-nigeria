 A frontline member of the People Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State, Prince Osobase Lewis, has said that the assumed seeming silence of the main opposition party the state, the PDP, over the current crisis rocking the state chapter of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, is strategic. Lewis who spoke while responding to questions from newsmen at his country home in Ewohimi, in the Esan South East LGA of Edo State over the weekend, noted that it is a common phenomenon that crisis must as a matter of necessity crop up within political party establishments and that all parties at one stage or the other are bitten by the crisis bug. He however maintained that members of the PDP unlike the ruling party have always come out of crisis clean and do not let crisis fester unnecessarily for a long period of time, because issues are quickly and speedily resolved. “We of the PDP are one family, so whenever there is misunderstanding our well grounded party elders and leaders quickly rally round and settle such differences with the speed of light.” On the chances of his party at the forthcoming election in Edo State, the Lagos based Philanthropist and Oil and Gas mogul turned politician noted that all Edolites have realised the deceit that is called APC and are now beckoning on the PDP to come and rescue them from the vampires that have continued to pilfer the commonwealth of the Edo people. He revealed that a number of top members of the party are facing one charge or the other with financial crime agencies in the country and that the day of reckoning for them is very close. He further noted that the PDP will not stand aside in the face of these anomalies being perpetrated by those he described as political rascals, but must accede to the yearnings of the people and rescue them. He advised the party faithful to remain steadfast and peaceful even in the face of provocation as he is optimistic that come the forthcoming election, the PDP shall remove them and the people from the perpetual suffering they have been subjected to over the years.
